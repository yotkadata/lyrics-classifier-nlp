13873,All Night Parking,Adele,I know you've got things to do (I do too)
13874,All Night Parking,Adele,I just want to spend all my time with you (feels so good)
13875,All Night Parking,Adele,I'm so hard to impress
13876,All Night Parking,Adele,Don't leave me on this stretch alone
13877,All Night Parking,Adele,When I'm out at a party
13878,All Night Parking,Adele,I'm just excited to get home
13879,All Night Parking,Adele,And dream about you
13880,All Night Parking,Adele,All night long
13882,All Night Parking,Adele,I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
13883,All Night Parking,Adele,"It's all happening so easily (like, ""Oh my God"")"
13884,All Night Parking,Adele,It's so hard to digest
13885,All Night Parking,Adele,"Usually, I'm best alone"
13886,All Night Parking,Adele,But every time that you text
13887,All Night Parking,Adele,I want to get on the next flight home
13888,All Night Parking,Adele,And dream next to you
13889,All Night Parking,Adele,All night long
13891,All Night Parking,Adele,Maybe it's the way you remind me of (where I come from)
13892,All Night Parking,Adele,Or how you make me feel beautiful (and then some)
13893,All Night Parking,Adele,The sight of you is dramatic
13894,All Night Parking,Adele,One glimpse and I panic inside
13895,All Night Parking,Adele,I get lost in our hours
13896,All Night Parking,Adele,'Cause you possess powers I can't fight
13897,All Night Parking,Adele,That's why I dream about you
13898,All Night Parking,Adele,All night long
13900,All Night Parking,Adele,All night long
13901,All Night Parking,Adele,All night
13902,River Lea,Adele,Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
13903,River Lea,Adele,And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
13904,River Lea,Adele,"But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made"
13905,River Lea,Adele,I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
13906,River Lea,Adele,Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
13907,River Lea,Adele,"But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough"
13908,River Lea,Adele,When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
13909,River Lea,Adele,"There was something in the water, now that something's in me"
13910,River Lea,Adele,"Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
13911,River Lea,Adele,I can't go back to the river
13913,River Lea,Adele,"But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
13914,River Lea,Adele,It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
13916,River Lea,Adele,"But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
13917,River Lea,Adele,It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
13918,River Lea,Adele,"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
13919,River Lea,Adele,"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
13921,River Lea,Adele,I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
13922,River Lea,Adele,That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
13923,River Lea,Adele,"Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance"
13924,River Lea,Adele,But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
13925,River Lea,Adele,"No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips"
13926,River Lea,Adele,I can't go back to the river
13928,River Lea,Adele,"But it's in my roots, it's in my veins"
13929,River Lea,Adele,It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
13931,River Lea,Adele,"It's in my roots, it's in my veins"
13932,River Lea,Adele,It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
13934,River Lea,Adele,"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
13935,River Lea,Adele,"Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
13937,River Lea,Adele,"So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
13938,River Lea,Adele,"Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
13939,I Drink Wine,Adele,How can one become so bounded
13940,I Drink Wine,Adele,By choices that somebody else makes?
13941,I Drink Wine,Adele,How come we've both become a version
13942,I Drink Wine,Adele,Of a person we don't even like?
13944,I Drink Wine,Adele,We're in love with the world
13945,I Drink Wine,Adele,But the world just wants to bring us down
13946,I Drink Wine,Adele,By putting ideas in our heads
13947,I Drink Wine,Adele,That corrupt our hearts somehow
13949,I Drink Wine,Adele,When I was a child
13950,I Drink Wine,Adele,Every single thing could blow my mind
13951,I Drink Wine,Adele,Soaking it all up for fun
13952,I Drink Wine,Adele,But now I only soak up wine
13954,I Drink Wine,Adele,"They say to play hard, you work hard"
13955,I Drink Wine,Adele,Find balance in the sacrifice
13956,I Drink Wine,Adele,Yet I don't know anybody
13957,I Drink Wine,Adele,Who's truly satisfied
13959,I Drink Wine,Adele,"You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)"
13960,I Drink Wine,Adele,"To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)"
13961,I Drink Wine,Adele,But the higher we climb
13962,I Drink Wine,Adele,Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh)
13964,I Drink Wine,Adele,So I hope I learn to get over myself
13965,I Drink Wine,Adele,Stop trying to be somebody else
13966,I Drink Wine,Adele,So we can love each other for free
13967,I Drink Wine,Adele,Everybody wants something
13968,I Drink Wine,Adele,You just want me
13970,I Drink Wine,Adele,Why am I obsessing
13971,I Drink Wine,Adele,About the things I can't control?
13972,I Drink Wine,Adele,Why am I seeking approval
13973,I Drink Wine,Adele,From people I don't even know?
13975,I Drink Wine,Adele,In these crazy times I hope to find 
13976,I Drink Wine,Adele,Something I can cling on to
13977,I Drink Wine,Adele,'Cause I need some substance in my life
13978,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Something real, something that feels true"
13980,I Drink Wine,Adele,"You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)"
13981,I Drink Wine,Adele,"High tides (high tides, high tides)"
13982,I Drink Wine,Adele,'Cause I want you so bad
13983,I Drink Wine,Adele,But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh)
13985,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself"
13986,I Drink Wine,Adele,Stop trying to be somebody else
13987,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) "
13988,I Drink Wine,Adele,Love you for free (each other for free)
13989,I Drink Wine,Adele,Everybody wants something from me
13990,I Drink Wine,Adele,You just want me
13992,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Listen, I know how low I can go"
13993,I Drink Wine,Adele,I give as good as I get
13994,I Drink Wine,Adele,You get the brunt of it all
13995,I Drink Wine,Adele,'Cause you're all I've got left
13996,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)"
13997,I Drink Wine,Adele,We both will find (we both find) peace of mind
13998,I Drink Wine,Adele,Sometimes the road less traveled
13999,I Drink Wine,Adele,Is a road best left behind (ahh)
14001,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Well, I hope I learn to get over myself"
14002,I Drink Wine,Adele,Stop trying to be somebody else
14003,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) "
14004,I Drink Wine,Adele,"Love you for free, yeah (each other for free)"
14005,I Drink Wine,Adele,'Cause everybody wants something from me
14006,I Drink Wine,Adele,You just want me
14008,I Drink Wine,Adele,"You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)"
14009,I Drink Wine,Adele,"To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)"
14010,I Drink Wine,Adele,But the higher we climb
14011,I Drink Wine,Adele,Feels like we're both none the wiser
14013,I Drink Wine,Adele,The only regret I have
14014,I Drink Wine,Adele,I wish that it was just at a different time
14015,I Drink Wine,Adele,A most turbulent period of my life
14016,I Drink Wine,Adele,Why would I put that on you?
14017,I Drink Wine,Adele,That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
14018,I Drink Wine,Adele,But because of that period of time
14019,I Drink Wine,Adele,Even though it was so much fun
14020,I Drink Wine,Adele,I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
14021,I Drink Wine,Adele,There was just memories in a big storm
14022,Someone Like You,Adele,"I heard, that you're settled down"
14023,Someone Like You,Adele,"That you found a girl and you're, married now"
14025,Someone Like You,Adele,"I heard, that your dreams came true"

14048,Someone Like You,Adele,Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
14049,Someone Like You,Adele,We were born and raised
14050,Someone Like You,Adele,In a summer haze bound by the surprise
14051,Someone Like You,Adele,Of our glory days
14053,Someone Like You,Adele,I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I

14064,Someone Like You,Adele,Regrets and mistakes their memories made
14065,Someone Like You,Adele,Who would have known how bittersweet
14066,Someone Like You,Adele,This would taste
14068,Someone Like You,Adele,Never mind I'll find someone like you
14069,Someone Like You,Adele,I wish nothing but the best for you
