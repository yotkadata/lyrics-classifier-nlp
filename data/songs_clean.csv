0,Wrong About Bobby,Eels,"I was wrong about Bobby
I admit he's not the dumbest angry, young nitwit
No he can cut it with the best
And you'd better get out of his way

His girlfriend keeps him living in
A world where fear will always win
And if you see him out tonight
Well, you'd better get out of his way

You gotta give it up for the new modern man
He's gonna have a ball
Give it all that he can

Someday he's gonna show us all, I bet
Out in the sun while we're all soaking wet
If it's a dry life that you want
Then you'd better get out of his way

You gotta give it up for the new modern man
He's gonna have a ball
Give it all that he can

I was wrong about Bobby, don't you know
He's had it tough and he had to make a go
But if he doesn't stop fucking with me
Well, he'd better get out of my way
Yeah, he'd better get out of my way
He'd better get out of my way"
1,Funeral Parlor,Eels,"Sitting in the funeral parlor
On the night before the day
Think I might have left the stove on
Think I might have left the door unlocked
I don't know if the stores will all be closed
When I get out
I don't know if the chores will all be done
When I get home

Sitting in the funeral parlor
Listen to the organ play
What if I forgot the trash cans
What if I forgot to telephone
I don't know if I wrote the number down
In my book
I don't know if I can stand to stay here
One more second"
2,I Like the Way This is Going,Eels,"I like your toothy smile,
It never fails to beguile.
Whichever way the wind is blowing
I like the way this is going.

I like the color of your hair,
I think we make a handsome pair.
I can only see my love growing
I like the way this is going

I like to watch TV with you,
There's really nothing that I would rather do.
Then maybe we can go to bed,
Get up and do it all again.

I like the way your pants fit,
And how you stand and how you sit,
Whatever seeds that you're sowing,
I like the way this is going.

I don't care about the past,
None of it was made to last,
It's not who you've known,
But who you're knowing,

I like the way this is going
I like the way this is going."
3,The Only Thing I Care About,Eels,"She had the eyes of someone older
I have the eyes that wander 'round
I couldn't see what really mattered

Caught hell from my boss
Don't care about my job
Caught a cold from the rain
Don't care if I'm cold
Played every record that I own today
But the only thing I care about got away

She was a walking work of art
I am a broken wind-up toy
I thought I knew what really mattered

Got a flat on the road
Don't care about my car
Lost twenty-six bucks
Don't care about my rent
Caught every episode on tv today
But the only thing I care about got away

She had a brilliant future
I have a past
I have my memories
But they're fading fast"
4,Jungle Telegraph,Eels,"Mama had an epidural 
Hoping I would be a girl
The night was black
The sky was booming
Darker clouds were surely looming
I heard screaming
Doctor shouts
And baby then I came out

And here I am

Found my way down the street
Chicken hawk's favorite meat
The man was big
The gun was loaded
He had cash but never showed it
I heard screaming
Bleeding throat
And baby I got on the boat

And here I am

Now I'm up here in the trees
Shakin' off the bugs and fleas
The days are long
The sun is beating
Each day I don't die is cheating
Send me some lovin'
Send me some lovin'
Send it now

Send it by giraffe 
Or jungle telegraph"
5,Birdgirl on a Cell Phone,Eels,"She has eyes disability blue
A German dog and strict curfew
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she's turned the script to another page
And she doesn't really give a damn
What you have to say

She makes a call on her friend's cell phone
The operator answers and says ""You're not alone""
And if one man's ceiling is another's dance floor
Then she'll be the one running to the sea shore
Trying to tell the seagulls
This is home

And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she'll be the one wiser than her age
Trying to get the message to your ear"
6,Your Lucky Day In Hell,Eels,"Mama grapped onto the milkman's hand
And then she finally gave birth
Years go by still I don't know
Who shall inherit this earth
And no one will know my name until it's on a stone

This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell

Waking up with an ugly face
Winston Churchill in drag
Looking for a new maternal embrace
Another tired old gag
Am I just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones

This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell

Father Theresa you can't make me into you
I never want to be like you
Why can't you see it's me
You know it's time to let me go

This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell"
7,What is This Note?,Eels,"The sun kisses the morning dew
Just the way that I'm kissing you
The birds are tweeting in sweet harmony
Teaching the free world how to be free

The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you
I want to give you everything
Me and the birds
Now we're gonna sing

When I wake up to your beautiful smile
Sometimes it takes me a little while
To realize that I am awake
And that living today will be
A piece of cake

And I won't keep you for myself
No you're not a toy on my shelf
The world needs to know that you're here
So spread your wings and fly, my dear

The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you
I want to give you everything
Me and the birds
Now we're gonna sing"
8,Spunky,Eels,"Spunky don't like her uniform
It never fit so good
Going back to the orphanage
And the place where her garage once stood 

Well it's a free-for-all
Free-for-all, free-for-all
It's a free-for-all you and me
And if you don't like what they are telling you
You can't teach a blind man to see 
Well I can see 

Spunky looks good in her bright red wig
Eating chocolate chip mint ice cream
A cat named lola with a violent past
Is balled-up asleep 'cross her knees 

And it's a free-for-all
Free-for-all, free-for-all
It's a free-for-all you and me
One day the world will be ready for you
And wonder how they didn't see 

Spunky knows she can save the world
In her own little way
Turning in her old uniform
'cause you know it really didn't pay 

'cause it's a free-for-all
Free-for-all, free-for-all
It's a free-for-all you and me
I'll walk through the world with your name on my tongue
And your picture etched on my screen"
9,Christmas is Going To the Dogs,Eels,"Get off your sled and go to bed, don't you ever tire?
Throw a bone, I'm finally home curled up by the fire
Snow is falling from the sky like ashes from an urn
Sweet dreams, my little one now it's my turn

Well, Christmas is going to the dogs
We'd rather have chew toys than yule logs
And things aren't looking very good, it's true
So, I'll just lay here and chew

Now, when I sleep I like to dream of rabbits in the snow
Jumping right into my jaws from their rabbit hole
Take one home and set him down right next to your shoes
Wake up to a big surprise my gift to you

And Christmas is going to the dogs
We'd rather have chew toys than yule logs
And things aren't looking very good, it's true
So, I'll just lay here and chew

And Christmas is going to the dogs
We're scarfing down the turkey and egg-nog
And things aren't looking very good, it's true
So, I'll just lay here and chew
So, I'll just stay here and chew"
10,The Man Who Didn't Know He'd Lost His Mind,Eels,"What can I tell you you haven't heard a hundred times
About the man who didn't know he'd lost his mind?
He didn't know he'd lost his mind
He really thought that he was fine

Mary and Joseph look away from what is here
It's not gonna be a pretty sight
Sight

If it could be a little more and a little less
Maybe I'd get it all together and get out of this mess
I'm gonna get out of this mess
And I'll do my very best
To get out of this mess
And I'll go where I can breathe"
11,Manchester Girl,Eels,"She hides in the library reading Henry Miller books
'Til they flash the lights, it's time to go
When she was a little kid she said
""Dad, I don't know why I feel so penniless inside""

She's on the promenade
She's looking for a dress
She's locked outside a world
Just a Manchester girl

Oh, I'll meet you there
By the old newsstand
Oh, I'll meet you there tonight

Shoot out at a neighbor's house
She pulls the covers over her head
She's counting the shots as they go by

In Pandora's litter box
Well, it's getting mighty high
That cat's gonna keep her up at night

Another scary dream
Another cigarette
She's locked outside a world
Just a Manchester girl

Oh, I'll meet you there
By the old newsstand
Oh, I'll meet you there tonight"
12,The Turnaround,Eels,"Another morning in the evening
Times still on the floor
And I don’t even know her name
Or if she lives here
Had enough but I want more
I don’t remember how I got here
And how long it’s been now
A day or two, maybe more

On the whole must remains
Never wanted anyway
I always bit the hand that beat me
And they rode me off
It’s easy not to care

Never trusted anyone 
Don’t see why I should now
Fade some blinking never fair

You’re all gonna be sorry when I’ll leave town
And get it together, for the turnaround

6 bucks in my pocket and these shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
6 bucks in my pocket and these shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
6 bucks in my pocket and these shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
6 bucks in my pocket and these shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
6 bucks in my pocket and these shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street
6 bucks in my pocket and these shoes on my feet
The first step is out the door and onto the street"
14,For You,Eels,"Where do you go when
The day is done
But you are not?
You look for a friend, but
Maybe I'm
All you got

Hard to pretend that I've always been here
Ready to be your man

And I heard sounds
Comin' through
The bedroom wall
Somebody cryin'
Echoin'
Down the hall

Never knew what it is to be a man
But now I know that I can

It's all here for you
It's all here for you

And when you need me
You know that I'm
Always here
It's not gonna be like
It ever was
Before, my dear

Hard to believe the dyin' words of a lyin' man
But that's not me
Here I am

It's all here for you
It's all here for you"
15,Looking Up,Eels,"Ah, it's looking up
Let me tell you what I mean
Used to be kind of bitter
Always had a babysitter
But I'm feeling much fitter
Now I'm pretty sweet
Back on my feet

Walking down the street
Yeah, I'm looking up
It's looking up

I used to be cruel
Kind of a tool
Like a damn fool
Now I'm oh-so-kind
Got no worried mind
I'm a real find
Yeah, it's looking up

I'm looking up
I'm looking up
It's looking up
Yeah, I'm looking up

I never had a clue, man
How it was gonna go
But it goes to show you
You just never know
It took a little while, but I'm a real fine man now
Never could, but I always can now

Time has healed me
Can you feel me looking up?
(Looking up)
Yeah, it's looking up

16,That's Not Really Funny,Eels,"Did you think that I would laugh
When you said I was small?
Did you think that that would pass
As if nothing at all?
You say a lot of funny things, my little bunny
And I almost always laugh
But that's not really funny

You play the little bells and tell a good story
You bake delicious pie and that's enough for me
But I am big I am your man 
And you're my little honey
And I like what you have to say
But that's not really funny

You must not continue to emasculate me
The neighbor children through the window
Clearly see
The little boy will wipe his nose because it's runny
Then point at me and laugh
But that's not really funny"
18,Buss Stop Boxer,Eels,"I don't miss where I came from
But each night I dream about being back home
When I wake up in the morning
I'm too tired
And tired of being alone

So I get up and go downtown
And pick me out a little piece of ground
Where I can prove something to the world
I can prove something to the world

Don't look at me
I'm the bus stop boxer

Daddy put us in the truck and
Dropped us off and said good luck
Then one lucky kid waiting for the bus
Made a winner out of one of us

Don't look at me
I'm the bus stop boxer

Going down to the railroad tracks 
Where people know that they better not relax
I'm the man
Baby I am the man
This is where I can make you understand"
19,Living Life,Eels,"Hold me like a mother would 
Like I've always known somebody should, yeah,
although tomorrow, it don't look that good 
Well, it just goes to show 

Though people say we're an unlikely couple 
I'm seeing double of you 

Oh,  

This is life 
And everything's all right 
Living living living living living living
living life 

Oh, hope for the hopeless
I'm learning to cope 
with the emotion-less mediocracy
Oh. 

Day-to-day living 

I cannot help but be restless
When everything seems so tasteless

And all the colors seem to have faded away. 

Oh, 
This is life 
 
And everything's all right 
Living living living living living living
living life 

Hold me like a mother would 
Like I've always known somebody should, yeah. 
although tomorrow, it don't look that good 
Well, it just goes to show 
Though people say we're an unlikely couple 
Doris Day, and Mott the Hoople 
 
Oh, 

This is life
And everything's all right 
Living living living living living living
living life"
21,Fashion Awards,Eels,"Let's go down to the fashion show
With all the pretty people that you don't know
We'll sit down in the velvet chairs
They'll hand awards out for best hair
And if we don't win one, well, then
We'll blow off our heads in despair
We'll blow off our heads in despair

I smell magic in the room
Flashing lights and sonic booms
Lovely saps all without a care
Nobody said that the world was fair
And if they did say so, well, then
We'll blow off our heads in despair
We'll blow off our heads in despair

Let's go down to the fashion show
With all the pretty people and piles of blow
We'll sit down in the velvet chairs
And hang on tight to our bus fare
And if it falls between the seats
We'll blow off our heads in despair
We'll blow off our heads in despair"
23,The Epiphany,Eels,"My old friend
I just want to go back
To that simpler time
When we were so happy and free
My old friend
Can I just go back?

My old friend
Please take me back
To those halcyon days
So far away now
Can I just go back?

I can't go back
But I can make today a memory to last"
24,If You See Natalie,Eels,"If you see Natalie
Send along this message
I know that you've been through
An awful lot of late

Girl,
Steady the trembling hand
That's what you do
Girl,
Steady your trembling hands
Then see what's in front of you

Friends and fortunetellers
They all say you're gonna die
If you don't brighten up
You know you gotta try

Girl,
Steady the trembling hand
That's what you do
Girl,
Steady your trembling hands
Then see what's in front of you

If you see Natalie
Send along this message
You may not need this world
But this world needs you here

Girl,
Steady the trembling hand
That's what you do
Girl,
Steady your trembling hands
Then see what's in front of you

You might not feel it now
But you're gonna get there
And see it somehow
You're gonna be alright, girl"
25,Stumbling Bee,Eels,"Sometimes I feel like a stumbling bee
Tryna fly in November
I feel so cold now, I might be dying
When things were good, I can't remember

Trying to fly away
But it looks like I gotta stay

My heart is busted up but not broke
I just might see, things get better
Where is the sunshine when it's cold
I guess 'til then, I'll wear a sweater

Trying to fly away
But it looks like I gotta stay

Sometimes I feel like a stumbling bee
Tryna fly in November
But I've been through much worse, I'll be back
I know the way there, I remember

Trying to fly away
But it looks like I gotta stay
But I think I know why, know why, no mind
I'm gonna find my way"
26,Son of a Bitch,Eels,"Mother couldn't love me
But that didn't stop me
From liking her
She was my mom
And I was no son of a bitch

Daddy was a drunk
A most unpleasant man
Asleep on the floor
Just inside the front door
With a smile underneath his red nose

The wrong look his way
Well that could really wreck his day
And believe me when I say
It would wreck your day too

Grandma took me in
Though times were pretty thin
Said I was no son of a bitch

Down on my knees
Begging god please"
28,You Are the Shining Light,Eels,"Come on baby now don't quit the show
I know you love a good fight
In your darkest night of the soul (guess what?)
You are the shining light (come on)

Bounce back, you always do
From some pretty rough nights
In the tunnel you're minin' through
You are the shining light (let's go)

I'm right here
I'm comin' with you

I can't handle it, you're making me mad
You know it's just not right
You don't know how beautiful you are
And you are the shining light (hello)

Come on, dummy
Get a clue

Come on baby now don't quit the show
You know you love a good fight
In the darkest night of the soul (give it up)
You are the shining light

Take it with you everywhere you go
Turn it on and make it bright
Ain't no reason to quit the show
When you are the shining light

Yes sir
Now, smile
Feels good, right?
That's more like it
Yeah"
30,Anything For Boo,Eels,"Anything for boo, oh boo, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
Anything for boo, my love is true
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true
 
That's our gal playing on the box
Tropicália in the afternoon
Making love while the curtains blow
Gal singing ""Baby, baby, baby, I love you""
 
Anything for boo, oh boo, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
Anything for boo, my love is true
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true
 
Don't have to miss each other any more
Here we are with nothing else to do
Abbey Road Deluxe or Lover on repeat
Stay singing 'bout being dramatic and true
 
Independent of the rest
Yet I am so dependent on you
Don't know if that's a good or bad thing
But not being with you
Is something that I don't know how to do
 
Anything for boo, oh boo, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do
Anything for boo, my love is true
It's true, it's true, it's true, it's true"
32,Efils’ God,Eels,"Efils good and the time is right
I'll bundle up and slip away
The count is down and the drip is up
It's time to split this hunk of clay

Now you can bring my suitcase
But you can't bring me
And you can have all the money
Cause you say that you must
But if you think that it matters
Take a look at me
And don't close your eyes as i turn into dust

Efils good
Don't tell me that i can't do this
As if you knew
But you don't know
How Efils good"
34,Baby Loves Me,Eels,"Record company hates me
The doctor says I'm sick
The bad girls think I'm just too nice
And the nice girls call me ""dick""

But baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

Policeman flashes the red lights
Coach says that I'm weak
Teacher says I'm not too bright
Bodybuilder calls me ""pipsqueak""

Baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

The neighbors don't like my flowers
The waiter don't like my tip
The librarian shushes me
Travel agent canceled my trip

Baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

Minister says I'm a demon
Dietitian says I'm a pig
Warmhearted say I'm freezin'
Promoter won't give me the gig

But baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

My tired body is breakin' down
The world is endin' soon
It's all crumblin' at my feet
Not sure what to do

But baby loves me!
And that's a real good thing
My baby loves me!
It's a beautiful thing

Baby loves me!
And she's smarter than you
My baby loves me!
Unlikely but true

Baby loves me!"
36,Some Friend,Eels,"Loyalty is easy when you're king
Doesn't matter who's around to bring

Some friend you turned out to be
Looking cool but anyone can see
That you don't know where you're going to
But I have some idea

Kowtow to everybody's whims
That's what'll finally do you in

Some friend you turned out to be
Looking cool but anyone can see
That you don't know where you're going to
But I have some idea

Sorry but I've got a train to catch
Gonna leave you and your schemes to hatch

Some friend you turned out to be
Looking cool but anyone can see
That you don't know where you're going to
But I have some idea"
37,Susan’s House,Eels,"Going over to Susan's house, walking south down Baxter Street
Nothing hiding behind this picket fence
There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles on the sidewalk
Where her house burnt down two years ago
People say that back then she really wasn't that crazy

Going over to Susan's house
Going over to Susan's house
She's gonna make it right

Down by the Donut Prince a fifteen year old boy lies on the sidewalk
With a bullet in his forehead
In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes
For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag
Meanwhile and old couple argues inside the Queen Bee
The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin

Going over to Susan's house
Going over to Susan's house
I can't be alone tonight

Take a left down echo park, a kid asks do I want some crack
T.v. sets are spewing Baywatch through the windows into black
Here comes a girl with long brown hair who can't be more than seventeen
She sucks on a red popsicle while she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage
And I'm thinking, that must be her sister
That must be her sister, right?
They go into the 7-11 and I keep walking

Going over to Susan's house [Repeat: x2]"
38,It’s A Motherf#&!@r,Eels,"It's a Motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same

It's a Motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls just me again

But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same

It's a Motherfucker
How much I understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand

And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same"
39,I Need Some Sleep (Dwin Remix),Eels,"I need you

That must be her sister, right?
They go into the 7-11 and I keep walking

Going over to Susan's house [Repeat: x2]"
41,Sweet Li'l Thing,Eels,"The Feeling of understanding is very rare
For someone like me it's hard to find
Somebody to care
She's got a way about her
Changes everything
She's got a way about her
She's my sweet lil' thing

Making love with her indie rock
Playing on the stereo
Holding hands going down the road
When she drives me home
She's got a magic about her
Makes me want to sing
She's got a magic about her
She's my sweet lil' thing

Spent the day lying in her bed
My nose against hers
Later we went for a drive
Didn't know where we were
Man I never felt so alive

Nobody gets the girl
But baby I do
Nobody gets me either
But she sees through
She's got a glow around her
Shines on everything
She's got a glow around her
She's my sweet lil' thing"
42,Rusty Pipes,Eels,"Rattle on the rusty pipes
Hit 'em hard, and hit 'em bright and clear
And make a noise, so everyone cannot mistake it's you

And let 'em know just what it's like
When you're not alright

Pray to god it won't get worse
That you'll be riding in a hearse to this
The party that you don't want to be ever invited to

But you'll be goin' anyway
However much you pray

Define a way, you'll find a way
No matter what I say

Rattle on the rusty pipes
Wake 'em up give them a fright
They can't just shake off like a scary dream
They have most every night

Don't even try I can't be saved
I'm beautiful and brave"
43,Losing Streak,Eels,"Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place
Where else could a creep like me
Meet such a pretty face?

Meetin' every day with the risin' sun
Lookin' up, it's lookin' like
My losing streak is done

Used to always feel like
Wished that I was dressed better
Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her

Feelin' like the weight that weighed a ton
Lifted off my shoulders now
My losing streak is done

Always felt like givin' in
To the feeling, ""I can't win""
But I took it on the chin
Now I'm finally cashin' in

Meetin' every day with the risin' sun
Lookin' up, it's lookin' like
My losing streak is done

My losing streak is done
I said my losing streak is done
Did you hear me?
I said my losing streak is done"
44,That's Not Her Way,Eels,"Yeah, she's alright
Just floatin' through her day
People throwin' words 'round
And talkin' such trash
There's so much she could say
That's not her way

That's not her way

Oh, I've been a fool
Other things on my mind
It's not hard to assess
The many terrible things she could say
But that's not her way

People, that's not her way

Yeah, she's alright
She knows who she is
She could stop and remind me of
The many ways she brightens my day
That's not her way

People, that's not her way"
45,Electro-Shock Blues,Eels,"Feeling scared today
Write down ""I am OK""
A hundred times the doctors say
I am OK
I am OK
I'm not OK

Skin is crawling off
Mopping the sweaty drops
Sticking around for this shit
Another day
Another day
Not another day

Pink pills feels good
Finally understood
Take me in your warm embrace
I am trying
I am trying"
46,Understanding Salesman,Eels,"A knock at the door means
Hello Jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to Niagara falls

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That I must prove to you

A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But I would rather take you
For a test drive

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That I must prove to you

While I look out
On the passing fields
The sun through the bugs
On the windshield
Makes me feel
Like I
Don't matter

A knock on the door
Hello Jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to Niagara falls"
47,Friendly Ghost,Eels,"If you're scared to die
You better not be scared to live
I've been spending all my days
Giving all I can give

Last night I heard someone walk in
Through my bedroom door
What they wanted I'm not exactly sure

A friendly ghost is all I need

Marking time on a broken watch
Counting days 'til the old pawn shop
Sells me back my saxophone
Then everyone's gonna leave me alone

Two times I thought I heard someone
Knocking on the glass
I hid my head and prayed that it would pass

A friendly ghost is all I need

If you're scared to die 
You better not be scared to live
I've been carrying 'round a grudge
Think I better forgive

Last night I heard footsteps walking 
On the attic floor
I got up and I opened up the door

A friendly ghost is all I need"
48,Elizabeth on the Bathroom Floor,Eels,"Laying on the bathroom floor
Kitty licks my cheek once more
And I could try
But waking up is harder when you want to die

Walter's on the telephone
Telling him I am not at home
Cause I think I am going 
To a place where I'm always high

My name is Elizabeth
My life is shit and piss"
50,The Good Old Days,Eels,"I know I'm not too much of a bargain
And you know that's not what you bargained for
As the hours turn into days
Pretty soon lost in the haze
It's up to you and me
And who's to say
These could be the good old days

I like waking up after a bad dream
Makes it feel like life ain't bad
Little kids go out to play
They're just happy it's another day
It's up to you and me
And who's to say
These could be the good old days

I guess I could be a quiet hero
No one knows the good I've done
You're not sure, well that's okay
Cause I am and I'm not afraid
It's up to you and me
And who's to say
These could be the good old days"
51,Fucker,Eels,"Came home tonight
Felt like I'd die of loneliness
Strange you think
Popularity

Looking for a simple life
Life ain't simple
I'm tired and sick but I
Don't want to be alone

I'll go to a party
But I don't really want to
For now I'm sitting out here on my porch
Writing in the dark air
Listening to
My little black cat maow

Trying to vent some of the terrible passion
That's coursing through me
Something about you
Something about spending the afternoon
Asleep in your arms

I hate you
Fucker"
52,Suicide Life,Eels,"You think you'll get under ol' monsieur's lid
And try to imagine all the things that he did
You don't know where I'm gonna go
You don't know where I'll go

I'll go none too bravely
Into the night
I'm so tired of living
The suicide life
That ain't no reason to live

Wake up in the night and think of all the years
Falling from the ceiling and covering your ears
You don't know how you're gonna get out
You don't know how you'll get out

I'll go none too bravely
Into the night
I'm so tired of living
The suicide life
That ain't no reason to live

Call up your best friend
And tell him a lie
You've got to be kidding
I'm not really high
I don't know where I'm gonna go
I don't know where I'll go

I'll go none too bravely
Into the night
I'm so tired of living
The suicide life
That ain't no reason to live"
53,Susan's House Acoustic,Eels,"Goin' over to Susan's house walking south down Baxter street
Nothin' hidin' behind this picket fence
There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles
On the sidewalk where her house burnt down 2 years ago
People say back then she really wasn't that crazy

Goin' over to Susan's house
Goin' over to Susan's house
I can't be alone tonight

Down by the donut prince a 15 year old boy
Lies on the sidewalk with a bullet in his forehead
In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes
For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag
Meanwhile an old couple argues inside the Queen Bee
The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin

Goin' over to Susan's house
Goin' over to Susan's house
She's gonna make you right

Take a left down Echo Park a kid asked do I want some crack
TV sets are spewing bay watch through the windows into black

Here comes a girl with long brown hair who can't be more than 17
She sucks on a red Popsicle while she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage
And I'm thinking that must be her sister, that must be her sister right?
They go into the 7-eleven and I keep walking and I keep walking

Goin' over to Susan's house
Goin' over to Susan's house
I can't be alone tonight
Goin' over to Susan's house"
54,"Souljacker, Pt. II",Eels,"Souljacker can't get my soul
Ate my carcass in a black manhole
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can shoot me up full of bullet holes
But the souljacker can't get my soul

Souljacker can't get my soul
Left my carcass with the worms and moles
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can hang my neck from the old flagpole
But the souljacker can't get my soul"
56,The Deconstruction,Eels,"The deconstruction has begun
Time for me to fall apart
And if you think that it was rough
I tell you nothing changes
Till you start to break it down

And break apart
I'll break apart
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart

The reconstruction will begin
Only when there's nothing left
But little pieces on the floor
They're made of what I was
Before I had to break it down

And break apart
I'll break apart
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart

And every block you've built on
It's going to come right out

And break apart
I'll break apart
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart
Right now it's going to start
I'll break apart

I'll break apart

I'll break apart"
57,I'm a Hummingbird,Eels,"The old oak tree had roots so far down in the ground
I fell from it and hit the dirt without a sound
I dreamt at night of growing wings so I could fly
A caterpillar to a moth before I die

I plodded through, ordinarily earthbound
I knew my feet could never leave the ground
I went about my way, unsteady and afraid
How could I know I was headed for this day?
All the seconds
And the minutes
And the hours
And the days
And the weeks
And the months
And the years of my life

It was all worth it
To be here now

I'm a hummingbird
Floatin' tree to tree
I'm a hummingbird
Beautiful and free

The old oak tree was dead, I had to cut it down
The sapling roots were new and sprouting through the ground
New worlds were taking shape, unseen and unknown
A branch to rest upon
A place to call my own

Something had changed, and I'm not sure how or why
I wasn't dreaming, I was awake, I was alive
Gave up the ghost, he had nothing left to say
But it was him who brought me to this day
All the seconds
And the minutes
And the hours
And the days
And the weeks
And the months
And the years of my life

It was all worth it
To be here now

I'm a hummingbird
Floatin' tree to tree
I'm a hummingbird
Beautiful and free"
58,The Stars Shine in the Sky Tonight,Eels,"I can't live in a world that you have left behind
Seen a lot, been through too much
But this is where I draw the line

It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And I just want to go with you

December it's a lonely month
In a year of lonely days
It's hard to tell which way is up
Or down or out or through the haze

People cheat and people lie
While you just watch it all go by
Counting days until you die

The stars shine in the sky tonight
Like a path beyond the grave
When you wish upon the star
There's two of us you need to save

It's not where you're coming from
It's where you're going to
And I just want to go with you"
60,Man Up,Eels,"In my heart of hearts I know it well
Been giving myself the soft sell
Anyone can see that I've been running away
Not facing the day that's here

It's time to man up
I'm man enough
It's time to man up
I'm man enough
I'm man enough for you
It's time to man up

The phone is off, the blinds are down
Me and my heart are out of town
The sign is hammered up
Do not disturb
Don't say another word to me

It's time to man up
I'm man enough
I'm man enough for you
It's time to man up
I'm man enough
I'm man enough for you
It's time to man up

In my heart of hearts I know it well
I hit the ground hard when I fell
Not licking wounds but more like sewing them up
Man it was rough for me

But it's time to man up
I'm man enough
I'm man enough for you
It's time to man up
I'm man enough
I'm man enough for you
It's time to man up"
62,There's Something Strange,Eels,"The kids are screaming and the wife is crying
Sunday morning ain’t no time to find
Things are breaking he is rabid he is riven
It’s very clear that the kids are not alright

When grey told me that he didn’t like my curtains
Just to sad, in [?] not keys
He turns some classic rock on the radio
And points the speakers right in my face

There’s something strange going on over there
Somebody should call the cops I swear
I don’t know what’s going on for sure
Inside the nightmare next door

The walls are shaking with his mannin foot steps
Look out for vulcano, she’s gonna blow
The kids are crying out I know that ain’t please
It throws the christmas tree right out the window

There’s something strange going on over there
Somebody should call the cops I swear
I don’t know what’s going on for sure
Inside the nightmare next door

It starts the day with the hit on the porche and
He wakes us up with a hackin [?]
He in some night on a basketball court
I’m tryina sleep you stupid git!

There’s something strange going on over there
Somebody should call the cops I swear
I don’t know what’s going on for sure
Inside the nightmare next door
Somebody should call the cops I swear."
63,Novocaine for the Soul,Eels,"Life is hard
And so am I
You'd better give me something
So I don't die
Novocaine for the soul
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

Life is white
And I am black
Jesus and his lawyer
Are coming back
Oh my darling
Will you be here
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

Guess who's living here with the great undead
This paint by numbers life is fucking with my head, once again

Life is good
And I feel great
'Cause mother says I was
A great mistake
Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me something to fill the hole
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out"
66,Trouble With Dreams,Eels,"There's nothing that I want to do
More than get alone and be with you
Trouble with dreams is they don't come true
And when they do they can't catch up to you

You don't need a thing from me
But I need something big from you
'Cause you know I've got an awful lot of big dreams

I'm walking down a lonely road
Clear to me now but I was never told
Trouble with dreams is you never know
When to hold on and when to let go

If you let me down it's alright
At least that leaves something for me
'Cause you know I've got an awful lot of big dreams

This is the life that I must lead now
Crossing fingers and wiping brow
Trouble with dreams is you can't pretend
Something with no beginning has no end

You don't need a thing from me
But I need something big from you
'Cause you know I've got an awful lot of big dreams"
67,Walking Cloud,Eels,"Well I just heard it the other day
My little lady got things she don't say
In front of me and I'm not to proud
She tells her friends my name is walking cloud

Well it sounds to me like an Indian name
And I'm not so sure that I want my fame
To hinge on the fact that I'm a bad egg
She says I'm like a big black cloud on legs

Well I'm not so bad I must defend myself
I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf
Well it's a crazy mixed up life
When it's hard for man and wife
To get along in a crowd
When you're walking cloud

Well I guess I can be such a bitter old f*ck
And it's true that I've fallen on some pretty hard luck
But I think she's forgetting all the things we vowed
Ain't it wrong to call your man a walking cloud?

Cause I'm not so bad I must defend myself
I like dogs and birds and records on the shelf
Well it's a crazy mixed up life
When it's hard for man and wife
To get along in a crowd
When you're walking cloud

Well I just heard it the other day
My little lady got things she don't say
In front of me and I'm not to proud
She tells her friends my name is walking cloud"
69,Are We Alright Again,Eels,"Walking down the street
Or walking on the moon
What's it matter
Now to my cocoon?
Step into the sunshine
Man, it feels good
Birds and bees jamming
A theme for the neighborhood

Are we alright again?
Are we around he bend?
Am I lucky or brave?
Are you stronger today?
Are we alright again?
Yeah, I think we're alright

Look up at the sky
Don't you think you could
Birds and bees jamming
Their tune for the neighborhood, they sing
""Do you wanna fly?"" Hmm
""Do you wanna get high?"" Yeah, I do
""High up here where we are,"" let me up there
""Well, don't you know it's not that far?""

Are we alright again?
Are we all on the mend?
Am I lucky or brave?
Are you stronger today?
Are we alright again?
Yeah, I think we're alright

Looking back, I don't know how
But I can see clear up ahead
Smiling skies with a chance of ""yes""
Maybe it's time to get out of bed

Hey, Mr. Bluebird, give me a hit of that
And pass it over to that mangy cat
Well, he's been through a lot now, more than you and me
Let's give him what we've got, that's who you wanna be

Are we alright again?
Can I finally attend?
Am I lucky or brave?
Are you stronger today?
Are we alright again?
We are all among friends
Are you lucky or brave?
Am I stronger today?
Are we alright again?
Yeah, I think we're alright"
70,Love of the Loveless,Eels,"Don't got a lot of time
Don't give a damn
Don't tell me what to do
I am the man
If there's a god up there
Something above
God, shine your light down here
Shine on the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless

Don't have too many friends
Never felt at home
Always been my own man
Pretty much alone
I know how to get through
And when push comes to shove
I got something that you need
I got the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
For love of the loveless

All around you people walking
Empty hearts and voices talking
Looking for and finding
Nothing

Don't got a lot of time
Don't really care
Not selling anything
Buyer beware
If there's a god up there
Something above
God, shine your light down here
Shine on the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
For love of the loveless

Don't got a lot of time
Don't give a damn
Don't tell me what to do
I am the man
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
For love of the loveless
Love of the loveless"
72,Mr. E’s Beautiful Blues,Eels,"The smokestack is spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye
The Elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The Ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
Oh

The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
(Come on!)

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you it's quite a scare

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor still he's moving to another town
(and I don't believe he'll come back)

God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

Your mind don't know how you're taking all the shit you see
Don't believe anyone but most of all don't believe me

God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh [Repeat: x4]"
73,St. Elizabeth Story,Eels,"Strolling down the green path way
With my fellow invalids
Halloween party tonight
In the women's gym

[Chorus:]
Saturday night at the dance
I'd ask you if I dance

Men's ward wants me back
By ten, not far
Take down your half mask and I'll
See who you are

[Chorus]

At three o'clock this morning
Look through the glass
I'll blink the floor lights on and off
Like ships that pass

74,Fresh Feeling,Eels,"You don't have a clue
What it is like to be next to you
I'm here to tell you
That it is good
That it is true

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling

Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling

Try
Try to forget what's in the past
Tomorrow is here
Love,
Orange sky above lighting your way
There's nothing to fear

Birds singing a song
Old paint is peeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling

Words can't be that strong
My heart is reeling
This is that fresh
That fresh feeling

Some people are good
Babe in the 'hood
So pure and so free
I'd make a safe bet
You're gonna get whatever you need"
75,Cancer for the Cure,Eels,"The kids are diggin' up a brand new hole
Where to put the deadbeat mom
Grandpa's happy watching video porn
With the close-caption on
And father knows best
About suicide and smack
Well, hee hee hee

Cancer for the cure
Cancer for the cure
Buckle-up and endure now baby
Cancer for the cure

'Ol blue eyes is back again
But he was never here in the first place
A heart attack may be something to fear
But take a look out back
'Cause Courtney needs love
And so do I
Well, hee hee hee

Cancer for the cure
Cancer for the
Cure my baby
Buckle-up and endure now sweet thing
The cancer for the cure"
77,The Medication Is Wearing Off,Eels,"See the watch she gave me?
Well it still ticks away
The days I'm claiming back for me

The medication's wearing off
Gonna hurt not a little, a lot
Keep on tickin' you're not lickin' me

Step on a crack break your mother's heart
Red light green light black
Suicide e-mail do not delete
Plug it back in the jack
Start to be what they want you to be
And you see yourself as they see you

Sunrise on the corner of
Sunset and Alvarado
I think what the hell do I do now
Watch the day disintegrate
So I can stay up late and wait

See this watch she gave me?
Well it still ticks away"
78,It's a Motherfucker,Eels,"It's a motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls
Just me again
But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
How much I understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand
And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same"
79,"Souljacker, Pt. I",Eels,"Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah

Johnny don't like the teacher
Johnny don't like the school
One day Johnny is going to do somethin'
Show 'em he's nobody's fool
Oh yeah

Sisters brothers make better lovers
Family affairs down under the covers...
Trailer parks the broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you're bleeding

Sally don't like her daddy
Sally don't like her friends
Sally and Johnny watchin' TV
Waitin' for it to end
Oh yeah

Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah"
80,Railroad Man,Eels,"Feel like an old railroad man
Ridin' out on the Bluemont line
Hummin' along old dominion blues
Not much to see and not much left to lose
And I know I can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but I'll know how to find my way back

I feel like an old railroad man
Who's really tried the best that he can
To make his life add up to something good
But this engine no longer burns on wood
And I guess I may never understand
The times that I live in are not made for a railroad man

I feel like an old railroad man
Getting on board at the end of an age
The station's empty and the whistle blows
Things are faster now and this train is just too slow
And I know I can walk along the tracks
It may take a little longer but I'll know how to find my way back"
81,The Sound of Fear,Eels,"Sun comes up on the old neighborhood
Spray-painted bricks and dead firewood
Well I don't know where I'm gonna be next
I don't care where I'm gonna be

Next time if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another
Sound of fear

Some people like to call me Chuck
It's Charles and you are shit outta' luck
If you think you know what happens next
You think you know what happens

Next time if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another
Sound of fear

Sun goes down on the old neighborhood
Dark, damp the stop where I once stood
I don't know where the bus stops next
And I don't care where the bus stops

Next time if you think of it
You might remember me as
The one who let you down
But never made another
Sound of fear

The sound of fear
I can't hear
The sound of fear"
82,Dead of Winter,Eels,"Standing in the dark outside the house
Breathing in the cold and sterile air
Well I was thinking how it must feel
To see that little lighter
And watch it as it disappears
And fades into
And faded into the night

So I know you're going pretty soon
Radiation sore throat got your tongue
Magic markers tattoo you
And show it where to aim
And strangers break their promises
You won't feel any
You won't feel any pain

And the streets are jammed with cars
Rockin' their horns
To race to the wire
Of the unfinished line

Thought that I'd forget all about the past
But it doesn't let me run too fast
And I just want to stand outside
And know that this is right
And this is true
And I will not
Fade into
Fade into the night

Standing here in the dark"
84,Restraining Order Blues,Eels,"Life goes on
Nothing is new
Judge made it clear
I can't be near you
Everybody knows that I'm not a violent man
Just someone who knows he's in love

I made mistakes
Everyone does
Don't know why I did
I guess just because
No one gets through to me the way that you do
Now I know I'm in love

Baby, it's a little much
To never touch you
When I know I'll never
Find another love like this

Life goes on
Nothing is new
Passing the days
Thinking 'bout you
Everybody knows that I'm not a violent man
Just someone who knows he's in love"
86,The Other Shoe,Eels,"It's a beautiful morning 
The sky is black as ink
The city's sleeping still
And soon they'll wake up
To the stink

And soon they'll wake up
To the stink of life passing them by
Wake up and smell the stink of their lives

The garbage trucks are coming
To take your shit to the dump
You're smelling pretty now
Such a pretty little lump
A pretty little lump of flesh
Who's lost you way
Another night another day

And when you sleep at night
Dreaming of the pretty things
Don't be too surprised
When the telephone rings

I'll be sitting here
Waiting for the other shoe to drop
I'll be sitting here
Waiting for the other shoe to drop"
87,On My Feet,Eels,"One, two, three
Two, two, three

I am a man
In great pain over
Great beauty
It's not easy
Standing on my feet
These days

But you know I'm pretty sure that
I've been through worse
And I'm sure I can take the hit

I pushed the bed against the window today
So there'd only be one side
Well, it's a little less lonely that way
But I'm still dying inside

When I wake up
In the middle of the night
No one's gonna tell me
I'll be all right

So many thousands
Of days in my life
That I don't remember
And a small handful
Of days that I do
Hold near to my heart

And one of those days
That I remember well
Is about me and you

When it's time
To look back on my life
Most of it won't seem so important
The shit that matters
And what I'll really miss
Is falling asleep with your arms around me

Waking up knowing that you're there
Making everything feel right in the world

People sleeping
In Hazmat suits
Taping up their windows
It's a mad, mad, mad, mad, mad, mad world
And it's hard to make any sense of it

But one thing I know that is true in this world
Is the love that I felt for you

Being on my feet these days
Well, it's a wonder I survive
No one taught me how to live on my own
I'm running scared

One sweet day I'll be back on my feet
And I'll be all right

I just gotta get
Back on my feet"
89,This Is Where It Gets Good,Eels,"With a lustful admiration
I look upon you
Can't wait until tomorrow
The things that we'll do

And this
Is where
It gets good

Permission to speak freely?
Well, I really must confess
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Gettin' out of your dress

And this
Is where
It gets good

The sky in your eyes
The earth in your touch
The spirits come together
Well, it's almost too much

And this
Is where
It gets good"
92,The Gentle Souls,Eels,"I chewed her up and threw her out
Out on the street like a garbage sack
And Everyday she's calling me up
I don't see why she'd want to come back 

Knocking on her best friends door
Is it okay if I crash here?
She never had a fighting chance
Against a heart so full of holes
But she didn't know what she'd gotten into
She belongs with the gentle souls

There was a time I can recall
When I believed everything I said
And I can't blame her for lapping up 
The petty lies that she was fed
Looking for a strangers help
I don't know who I should believe

She never had a fighting chance
Against a heart so full of holes
But she didn't know what she'd gotten into
She belongs with the gentle souls

I chewed her up and threw her out
And changed the lock on my front door
She tried her key and it didn't work
I don't know why she's back for more

Knocking on her best friends door
Is it okay if I crash here?
She never had a fighting chance
Against a heart so full of holes
But she didn't know what she'd gotten into
Now she belongs with the gentle souls
Now she belongs with the gentle souls

She never had a fighting chance"
93,To Lick Your Boots,Eels,"Miss o'malley didn't mean what she said
Got a heart but a head full of lead
She can dream but she never can do it
You're alright and you're gonna get through it

People spend their days
Trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they're not fit
To lick your boots

Nothing harder to watch
Than an Englishman
Trying to cry
Even if he can
He can dream but he never can do it
Saying you, you're the one that blew it

People spend their days
Trying to find new ways
To put you down all over town
But they're not fit
To lick your boots"
95,Dog Faced Boy,Eels,"Coming home from the school today
Crying all along the way
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Begging ma to shave me please

You little punks think you own this town
Well someday someone's gonna bring you down
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy

You take back what you said now
That's the last time I cry
You don't know what it is to be a friend now
Til I walk beside you on the street now

Ma won't shave me
Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy

Life ain't pretty for a dog faced boy
[Repeat x3]

Going back to the school tomorrow
Hang my hairy head in sorrow
Ain't no way for a boy to be
Ain't no way to set me free now

Ma won't shave me
Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy

Ma won't shave me 
Jesus can't save me
Dog faced boy"
96,Daisies of the Galaxy,Eels,"Take heart, my little friend
And push back your seat
Soon we'll be far away
Far from the street
Where you learned how to be
Not what you are

Up on the shoulder
There is a town
With a little motel
And an old movie house
We'll go to a movie
Whatever it is

Watching the movie
The world's gonna end
And there ain't no place for
A boy and his friend to go

I'll pick some daisies
From the flower bed
Of the galaxy theater
While you clear your head
I thought some daisies
Might cheer you up"
97,Souljacker Part II,Eels,"Souljacker can't get my soul
Ate my carcass in a black manhole
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can shoot me up full of bullet holes
But the souljacker can't get my soul

Souljacker can't get my soul
Left my carcass with the worms and moles
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can hang my neck from the old flagpole
But the souljacker can't get my soul"
98,Mr E's Beautiful Blues,Eels,"The smokestack spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye
The elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The ringmaster's telecaster sings on an empty stage

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The girl with the curls
And the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawling out her window
'Cause her daddy, he just don't care, come on

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The clown with the frown
Driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger
Let me tell you gave us quite a scare

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

The kids flip their lids
When their lids hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor
Still he's moving to another town

And I don't believe he'll come back

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

Well, I don't know
How you take in all the shit you see
No don't believe anyone
And most of all don't believe me, believe you

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day

Goddamn right it's a beautiful day
Goddamn right it's a beautiful day"
99,Mystery of Life,Eels,"How does a little baby know how to smile?
How does a cat land on his feet?
Why does it feel like you've been here before?
How do the two perfect people meet?

Pain in my heart, twistin' like a knife
Disappeared just overnight
Good morning, mystery of life

La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

How does a mother wake up in the night
When she knows her daughter's sad
On the other side of the earth?
How does she know the kind of day she's had?

Ghosts flyin' all around my life
Sent a message both bold and bright
Good morning, mystery of life

La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

How does a man lose all that he loves
And find the strength to rise above
Havin' nothing to call his own?
How does he find that he still has love?

No more sorrow, no more strife
Always some daylight followin' the night
Good morning, mystery of life

La la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la la

100,You're My Friend,Eels,"You are my friend
You done a lot of things for me
And I won't forget them
Do you know how you mean to me?
You are my friend
And no matter what I'm doing you
You are there for me

Lost at sea

To come through the clutch

Feel like I ow you

You're my friend
From the day we meet
Till the bitter end

101,World of Shit,Eels,"In this world of shit
Baby you are it
A little light that shines all over
Must take over 
And see us through the night

Daddy was a troubled genius
Mama was a real good egg
Why don't we just get together
For whatever
And see if it's alright

I spent so many days
Just staring at the haze
And I think that that's a book
That I don't have to write again

Now when I rise I shine
I've got you on my mind
And the question isn't if
The question is merely when

Baby, I confess
I am quite a mess
So let's get married and 
Make some people
More than equal 
In this world of shit

I will make a pledge
To get down off the ledge
You and I belong together
And forever we will have 
Our love"
103,Happy Hour (We're Gonna Rock),Eels,"Know is ..hope
and if you're dirty and you need a shower
you'd better be clean for a happy hour

The kid out of the river jack

and we're gonna show you how to rock
like this 
we're gonna rock..like this 
we're gonna rock..this is it"
104,Dark And Dramatic,Eels,"She's beautiful 
But she doesn't fight fair
What makes her think 
She can go there
Trouble, oh trouble 
It's too soon for you
I asked myself sternly 
""Is this what you wanna do?""
The answer is clear and easy to see
I know in my heart she's too dark and dramatic 
For me

I love her so much 
Why she messing it up
Maybe something in her past 
Makes her sure it won't last
Trouble, oh trouble 
It's too soon for you
I asked myself sternly 
""Is this what you wanna do?""
The answer is clear and easy to see
I know in my heart she's too dark and dramatic 
For me"
105,Susan's House,Eels,"Going over to Susan's house, walking south down Baxter Street
Nothing hiding behind this picket fence
There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles on the sidewalk
Where her house burnt down two years ago
People say that back then she really wasn't that crazy

Going over to Susan's house
Going over to Susan's house
She's gonna make it right

Down by the Donut Prince a fifteen year old boy lies on the sidewalk
With a bullet in his forehead
In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes
For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag
Meanwhile and old couple argues inside the Queen Bee
The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin

Going over to Susan's house
Going over to Susan's house
I can't be alone tonight

Take a left down echo park, a kid asks do I want some crack
T.v. sets are spewing Baywatch through the windows into black
Here comes a girl with long brown hair who can't be more than seventeen
She sucks on a red Popsicle while she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage
And I'm thinking, that must be her sister
That must be her sister, right?
They go into the 7-11 and I keep walking

Going over to Susan's house [Repeat: x2]"
106,Mansions of Los Feliz,Eels,"Well it's a pretty bad place outside this door
I could go out there but I don't see what for
And I'm happy living in the dark
On the edge of my mind
And it's nobody else's business

Now it's just me, myself, and the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz

Well the city's on fire
You can smell the flesh
And the screams like dogs in the wilderness
And where do all the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Like it's everyone else's business

And at best they'll find the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz

La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da, la

Well he's gone out again
And left you all alone
Well come on over, I'm always home

And where do all the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Well I do mean to make it my business

And it's just me, myself, and the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz

107,Mighty Fine Blues,Eels,"Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed

Walk down any street
Ask the people you meet
""What is it about this place
Keeps you on your feet?""

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed

Night is coming down
Closer to the ground
Gonna have a little fun
While I'm still around

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am
Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes indeed

Don't believe the words they say to you
When they are so absurd
And don't believe a word they say about me
Because I'm feeling mighty fine

I think I gotta go
I think I'm gonna die
Oh, my God, something's wrong
The end is coming near because I'm

Feeling mighty fine
Feeling mighty fine at this time, yes I am

109,Packing Blankets,Eels,"Today is a lovely day to run
Start up the car with the sun

Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen

Cross when the drawbridge light is green
Don't look back to that messed-up scene

Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen

And all our troubles will be gone
Blowing out over that bridge
Floating up into the sky
Making the storm clouds cry

Put out that smoke and breath some air
Get a new name and cut your hair

Packing blankets and dirty sheets
A roomful of dust and a broom to sweep up
All the troubles you and I have seen"
110,Swimming Lesson,Eels,"If the world's a rotten place
You better just forget it
In the crowd just another face
Gonna make 'em regret it

Take a heart and squash it hard
Like a little grape
Push it down 'tween boot and ground
'Til it loses shape

And if you feel like you can't swim
When you're thrown in the lake
Just watch the bugs
Passin' by you as you
Slip under their wake
Again

If you let your feelings shine
You better cover 'em up, kid
Ain't no sense in wastin' time
Dream behind your eyelids

Take a heart and squash it hard
Like a little bug
Swig it down and spit it out
And kick it under the rug

And if you feel like you can't swim
When you're thrown in the lake
Just watch the bugs
Passin' by you as you
Slip under their wake
Again

Take a heart and squash it hard
Like a little ant
Scrape it off the sole of your shoe
On the welcome mat

And if you feel like you can't swim
When you're thrown in the lake
Just watch the bugs
Passin' by you as you
Slip under their wake
Again

Ooh
Ooh"
111,Dirty Girl,Eels,"I like a girl with a dirty mouth
Someone that I can believe
We had a window, not open too long
But that time is good and gone

And if I ever see her again
Just walking by with some new guy
I know that we will need to pretend
And hope our eyes keep telling lies

Sit on the back porch and wonder 'bout her
What is she doing right now?
Making somebody a happier man
Dying her hair back to brown

Once in a while your life gets so good
Worth all the trouble of the past
That was the case but I think I always knew
Good things don't ever last

And if I ever see her again
Just walking by with some new guy
I know that we will need to pretend
And hope our eyes keep telling lies

I like a girl with a dirty mouth
Know that I can trust her
We had our time but it didn't last too long
And that time is good and gone

That time is good and gone
That time is good and gone"
113,I Like the Way This Is Going,Eels,"I like your toothy smile,
It never fails to beguile.
Whichever way the wind is blowing
I like the way this is going.

I like the color of your hair,
I think we make a handsome pair.
I can only see my love growing
I like the way this is going

I like to watch TV with you,
There's really nothing that I would rather do.
Then maybe we can go to bed,
Get up and do it all again.

I like the way your pants fit,
And how you stand and how you sit,
Whatever seeds that you're sowing,
I like the way this is going.

I don't care about the past,
None of it was made to last,
It's not who you've known,
But who you're knowing,

I like the way this is going
I like the way this is going."
114,Efils' God,Eels,"Efils good and the time is right
I'll bundle up and slip away
The count is down and the drip is up
It's time to split this hunk of clay

Now you can bring my suitcase
But you can't bring me
And you can have all the money
Cause you say that you must
But if you think that it matters
Take a look at me
And don't close your eyes as i turn into dust

Efils good
Don't tell me that i can't do this
As if you knew
But you don't know
How Efils good"
115,Bombs Away,Eels,"Nobody listens to the whisperin' fool

Bombs away
To the safer house
Bombs away

The way it turn

I no longer gonna keep my mouth shut
Bombs away
Gonna shake the house

Baby think you're better
Watch your face
Master piece of hall 
About to feel this jack
Taught my bark to lit the dog
Get up
Bombs away
Take cover
Nothing gonna fall

Nobody listens to the whisperin' fool
Are you listen?
I know that you are
I been quiet as church ass mouse
Tip toe everywhere I go

I had enough for being complacent
I had enough for feedin' the mouse
I no longer gonna keep my mouth shut
Bombs away
Gonna rattle the house
Bombs away
I will be hurt

Cause you just might learn
Bombs away

December rolled around and you were counting on it
To roll out

Well, everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas

Well everybody's lookin' for you down at the house
The tree is looking so inspired
There's a yuletide groove waitin' for you to move
I'll go and throw another log on the fire

Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas

As days go by the more we need friends
And the harder they are to find

Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas"
119,Gone Man,Eels,"She used to love me but it's
Over now
That was a good thing that's
Gone man, gone

I pass the hours
Just to get by
Talk to the dogs
So I know that I'm alive

I never thought that I should quit
All the stupid crazy shit that I do
In the name of
Keepin' good things away

Some things you can
F*ck right up
Other things
Well, you better not screw up
My problem was
That I could not see
What was important
Right in front of me

I never though that I should quit
All the stupid crazy shit that I do
In the name of
Keepin' good things away

How much longer, man
For this earth?
It's here today
But it's gone man, gone

The epitaph scratched upon my stone,
""Here lies a man who just wanna be alone""

She used to love me but it's
Over now
That was a good thing that's
Gone man, gone

I take small comfort in a
Dying world
I'm not the only who's
Feelin' this pain"
120,I Am Building a Shrine,Eels,"I’m building a shrine
Deep inside my heart
It’s filled with all the little things
I’ll take when we’re apart

All the love you bring me, all the tender words you sing me
And all the suns within your smile
All the wisdom of your ways, enduring endless days
And all the love that never dies

Deep down in the cold ground
Touch as simply to be
But ‘ill be fine, with all them little things
That I’m taking with me

All the love you bring me, all the tender words you sing me
And all the suns within your smile
All the wisdom of your ways, enduring endless days

121,True Original,Eels,"She’s a true original
Not some store bought rebel
She can find her own way and whom
You’ll just have to let her

Whichever every path she finds 
It’s hers to take
And if she says she’s fine
I’ll just have to wait for her

She’s an artist in the world
She composes from the heart
The finish on he’s always there
Well before she starts

And any time she might
Get the words from
You just turn it up and you
You sing along with her

And if a gun was pointed at her
I would stand between the bullet and her
And if not being with me is what makes her happy
I’d take that bullet too

Whichever every path she finds 
It’s hers to take
And if she says she’s fine
I’ll just have to wait for her

She’s a true original"
122,That’s Not Really Funny,Eels,"Did you think that i would laugh when you said i was small
Did you think that that would pass as if nothing at all

You say a lot of funny things, my little bunny
And i almost always laugh, but that's not really funny

You play the little bells and tell a good story
You bake delicious pie and that's enough for me

But i don't think that i'm your man, and you're my little honey
And i like what you have to say, but that's not really funny

You must not continue to wear my ?? like me
The neighbour children threw the window to the sea

The little boy will wipe his nose bacause it's runny
Then point at me and laugh, but that's not really funny"
123,Spectacular Girl,Eels,"She's got a life livin' in her heart
She's got these eyes well, where do I start?
Like lookin' at the deep night sky
So many worlds inside her eyes
She's a

Spectacular girl

Part of the job of bein' her man
Is knowin' when to let go of her hand
Her kind of power, it can't be reigned in
To hold her back would be a sin
She's a

Spectacular girl

She sees the beauty in things we all miss
All good things are defined by her kiss
If you're feelin' like you can't believe
Well, then, how do you explain the miracle I see?
She's a

Spectacular girl
Spectacular girl

Not a desire and not a need
Some things just happen 'cause they have to be

I'm a man on a mission and I'm all about her
She's a

Spectacular girl
Spectacular girl

Aw yeah

124,Going Fetal,Eels,"Everyone is going fetal
It's the dance the kids all feel
Just get down under your desk
Feels like your mama's nest
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
It's the one that's really real
You're gonna love it if you give it a try
You just lay down like you're gonna die
Alright

Everyone is going fetal
If you feel like your fate is sealed
Then just get down and curl on up
Just like a little helpless pup
Alright

Everyone is going fetal"
125,End Times,Eels,"Crazy guy with a matted beard
Standing on the corner
Shouting out ""end times are near""
And nobody noticed him
But I can hear him loud and clear
She is gone now, and nowhere near
Seems like end times are here

I walk around a puddle in the street
And head on home
Outside my window there's a cat in heat
Shut up, cat, and leave me alone
There ain't no heat on round here
I don't feel nothing now
Not even fear
Now that end times are here

Now everyone's crazy, they've lost their minds
Just look at the world
It could all be over at any old time
And I can hear it loud and clear
The world is ending, and what do I care?
She's gone, end times are here"
126,"Souljacker, Pt. 1",Eels,"Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah

Johnny don't like the teacher
Johnny don't like the school
One day Johnny is going to do somethin'
Show 'em he's nobody's fool
Oh yeah

[Chorus:]
Sisters brothers make better lovers
Family affairs down under the covers...
Trailer parks the broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you're bleeding

Sally don't like her daddy
Sally don't like her friends
Sally and Johnny watchin' TV
Waitin' for it to end
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah"
128,It's A Motherfucker,Eels,"It's a motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls
Just me again
But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
How much I understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand
And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same"
130,"Souljacker, Pt. 2",Eels,"Souljacker can't get my soul
Ate my carcass in a black manhole
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can shoot me up full of bullet holes
But the souljacker can't get my soul

Souljacker can't get my soul
Left my carcass with the worms and moles
Souljacker can't get my soul
He can hang my neck from the old flagpole
But the souljacker can't get my soul"
133,What Is This Note?,Eels,"The sun kisses the morning dew
Just the way that I'm kissing you
The birds are tweeting in sweet harmony
Teaching the free world how to be free

The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you
I want to give you everything
Me and the birds
Now we're gonna sing

When I wake up to your beautiful smile
Sometimes it takes me a little while
To realize that I am awake
And that living today will be
A piece of cake

And I won't keep you for myself
No you're not a toy on my shelf
The world needs to know that you're here
So spread your wings and fly, my dear

The day is new and a good one too
How can I prove my love to you
I want to give you everything
Me and the birds
Now we're gonna sing"

Lies only with them

137,Stick Together,Eels,"Ford it again missing in the crowd
a friendly voice, calling clear and loud 
my big mistake, thinking that I knew
how to get bye, independent on you

The immature, they have the chance 
quick to forget who brought em to the dance
loyalty is pair amount to me 
it's dirty clear we make a winning team 

We gotta stick together

138,Mistakes of My Youth,Eels,"In the waning days ahead,
I gotta look back down the road.
I know that it's not too late.
All the stupid things I've said,
And people I've hurt in my time.
I hope it's not my fate

To keep defeating my own self,
And keep repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating, 
The mistakes of my youth.

In the dark of night, I might
Be able to make myself think
That I'm still a younger man.
But when the light of day shines down,
There's no way to get around it,
I'm not the younger man.

I keep defeating my own self,
And keep repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating, 
The mistakes of my youth.

The choice is mine for making
A better road ahead
The road that I've been taking,
Headed for a dead-end,
But it's not too late to turn around

In the final moments
I hope that I know that I tried
To do best I could

To stop defeating my own self
And stop repeating yesterday.
I can't keep defeating myself,
I can't keep repeating, 
The mistakes of my youth"
139,Lone Wolf,Eels,"I am a lone wolf
I always was and will be
I feel fine, I am resigned to this
I am a lone wolf
I am a lone wolf

Got my cares
Wrapped up all nice and neat
In my suitcase
I'll take it down the street
To a place with plenty of space for me
I am a lone wolf

I am a lone wolf
It blows my mind
That people want to try to get inside my tired head
I am a lone wolf
I am a lone wolf

I am a lone wolf
Nobody needs to get too close to me
You'll only see this truth
I am a lone wolf"
140,Waking Up,Eels,"I don't want nobody
I don't need that shit
Nothing good every came
From any time I did
So what the f*ck is going on here
Tender hearted love
I was always dreaming falsely
I must be waking up

Lovers come and lovers go
Ironically so called
Love wasn't in the room
Two grifters that was all

Morning sun a sweet surprise 
Is finally looking up
The dream is over done and dusted
Now I'm waking up

I don't have any voice
You don't have any choice
Its best we get out of the way

Nothing new but everything
Everyday is grave
Anything can happen now
Nothing's ever safe
So why don't you just take my hand
And take a chance on love
The day is here and I won't blow it
I am waking up

And waking up next to you
Is all I really want"
141,Paradise Blues,Eels,"Scary little suicide bomber
On the way to paradise
Gonna take yourself and be with her
Killin' once and killin' twice

Well it's a real hard time
Singin' the paradise blues

Kinda hard to blame somebody
For goin' to a better place
For thinkin' there's some kinda magic
Up there past outer space

Well that's some crazy-ass shit
Singin' the paradise blues

I'm gonna walk these filthy streets
I'm gonna raise my head
I may not be in paradise
Woo, but I'm not dead

Ain't gonna fly blind
Singin' these paradise blues

Your contempt and your sarcasm
It's all so transparent
Why don't you give up the act now, kid
Woo, and let some love in?

Cause that's all that we got
Singin' these paradise blues"
142,Not Ready Yet,Eels,"There's a world outside
And I know 'cause I've heard talk
In my sweetest dream
I would go out for a walk

Gut I don't think I'm ready yet
Not feeling up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how

There's some happiness
And my stone face cracks again
Maybe sometime sooner or later

But I don't think I'm ready yet
Not feeling up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how

So if I leave my room
Don't you tell me to lighten up
Maybe sometime sooner or later

But I don't think I'm ready yet
Not feeling up to it now
Just not that steady yet
And I don't need you telling me how

I don't need you telling me how
I don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how

Don't need you telling me how
Don't need you telling me how
Don't
Don't need you telling me how"
145,In Our Cathedral,Eels,"We are safe
We are free
Always were and will be

Your heart's been battered
Your spirits broken
But there's a place where your heart can still be open
In our cathedral

Was a time, you forget
You were losing every bet
Your hope was shattered
Your trust betrayed
But you found a place where you don't need to be afraid
In our cathedral

And I hurt, but I'll heal
They can't tell us how to feel
The doors is locked now
All pain and fear is on the other side
Nothing can hurt us here
In our cathedral

We are safe
We are free
Always were and will be

Your dreams are broken
Your innocence lost
But there's a line
That can't be crossed
In our cathedral"
146,The Morning,Eels,"In the morning
When the birds are still asleep
You can feel it
No cars are on the street
It's anybody's day
It could go any way
Why wouldn't you want to make
The most of it?

In the morning
There's nothing left to prove
If it's your game
It's time to make a move
Don't look the other way
You're gonna have your say
Why wouldn't you want to make
It really count?

In the morning
Yesterday is just a dream
Out the window
Take a look at all you see
Baptized by the sun
Go on and have some fun
Why wouldn't you want to have
The greatest day?"

148,Dog's Life,Eels,"What would you say if I left this town tomorrow
I guess I would
But know I'd miss the train
I know I would

I'll take a dog's life
Just layin' in the sun
I'll take a dog's life
'cause I don't care for this one

Chasing trains and planes and rain
Where is my rain
Falling down upon a thirsty world
I never want to be the same

Another time I might have fit in alright
But not this time
I guess I'm just too soon
To change my tune

I'll take a dog's life
Just layin' in the sun
I'll take a dog's life

Chasing trains and planes and rain
Where is my rain
Falling down upon a thirsty world
I never want to be the same"

The trophy wives of the astronauts
And I won't listen to their words

Crazy auto-car gonna mow me down
Look at all the people like cows in a herd
Well, I like
Birds

If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on

I can't stand in line at the store
The mean little people are such a bore
But it's alright if you act like a turd
'Cause I like
Birds

If you're small and on a search
I've got a feeder for you to perch on

If you're small and on a search

152,Let's Ruin Julie's Birthday,Eels,"Let's ruin Julie's birthday
I didn't get my invite
Could be lost in the mail or something
I'm gonna be there tonight

I never cared about her anyway
And I guess she never cared
About me

And what do you mean that I can't go?
Where does it say that I'm a fool?
Doesn't she know that I'm an exception
To the rule?

Let's ruin Julie's birthday
I can see right through her act
She said something about me
And all the cool kids made a pact

I never cared about her anyway
And I guess she never cared
About me

And what do you mean that I can't go?
Where does it say that I'm a fool?
Doesn't she know that I'm an exception
To the rule?

Let's ruin Julie's birthday
What does she have to celebrate?
It's not a party if I'm not there
Just her stupid friends and a birthday cake

I never cared about her anyway
And I guess she never cared
About me

And what do you mean that I can't go?
Where does it say that I'm a fool?
Doesn't she know that I'm an exception
To the rule?

And what do you mean that I can't go?

Where does it say that I'm a fool?

To the rule?"
154,Pretty Ballerina,Eels,"I had a date with a pretty ballerina
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes
I asked her for this dance
And then she obliged me
Was I surprised, yeah
Was I surprised,
No not at all

I called her yesterday,
It should have been tomorrow
I could not keep
The joy that was inside
I begged for her to tell me
If she really loved me
Somewhere a mountain is moving
Afraid it's moving without me

I had a date with a pretty ballerina
Her hair so brilliant that it hurt my eyes
I asked her for this dance
And then she obliged me
Was I surprised, yeah
Was I surprised, no not at all

And when I wake on a dreary Sunday morning
I open up my eyes to find there's rain
And something strange within said,
""go ahead and find her
Just close your eyes, yeah
Just close your eyes and she'll be there""

She'll be there"
155,A Daisy Through Concrete,Eels,"Wake up the dying
Don't wake up the dead
Change what you're saying
Don't change what you said
Now that it's time that
I got out of bed

When I walk myself
Down Sycamore Street
The sun beats down
No shoes on my feet
And I stumble on
A daisy through concrete

Pink and brown babies
In pink stroller cars
Know that it's good
They don't care where they are
They know that home
Doesn't feel very far

When I walk myself
Down Sycamore Street
The sun beats down
No shoes on my feet
And I stumble on
A daisy through concrete

Here we go
Oh yeah
That's how I like it

Airplane is flying up in the sky
Making a pattern
With the white lines
Looks like a heart
Or maybe a pie

When I walk myself
Down Sycamore Street
The sun beats down
No shoes on my feet
And I stumble on
A daisy through concrete
A daisy through concrete"
156,Wooden Nickels,Eels,"Went down by the old courthouse
Stumbling through the streets
Had to get out of the house
Had to use my feet
And you may not think much of me now
But I think so damn much of you

Don't take any wooden nickels
When you sell your soul
A devil of a time awaits you
When the party's over
You're on your own

Trash truck coming up the road
Picking up the trash
Riding to a better place
Hoping we don't crash
Thinking how things
Have turned out
I never would've guessed it
This way

Don't take any wooden nickels
When you sell your soul
A devil of a time awaits you
When the party's over
You're on your own

And you may not think much of me now
But I think so damn much of you

Don't take any wooden nickels
When you sell your soul
A devil of a time awaits you
Now the party's over
I'm on my own"

All the songs you sing
All the flowers you bring
Are part of everything there ever was
And will be

Go on
You've got places to be
So many things to see
Don't worry about me
I'm already where I should be

Look up

Wanna think about me
Look out above the sea
And you can see that I'm doing
Just Fine"

160,Mental,Eels,"It's like I dressed up in my mamma's clothing
It's like I'm talking to a voice that doesn't exist
It's like I got a wire crossed upstairs
But all I want is just a little truth and that's it

They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
They say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all

Another anchorman is on the TV
He's got that far away and they can't look in his eyes
I turn the channel but nothing is changing
The only truth is that everything's a lie

They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
They say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all

There's truth in everything, there's truth in lies
With all this knowledge well I think I'm gonna be wise

They say I'm mental but I'm just confused
They say I'm mental but I've been abused
They say I'm mental 'cause I'm not amused by it all

161,Accident Prone,Eels,"A happy accident 
We're running into you 
Was all for my beating path 
God lost for my crew
Out of my element 
Lost all of the will 
I didn't anticipate 
A pleasant on dim

I was getting tired of 
Always being alone 
Good thing that I've always been so 
Accident prone

What made me go that way 
Well I really don't know 
Who do I have to think?
To what do I hope?
I was feeling sober aft
All my chances blow 
Good think that I've always been so 
Accident prone

Little Archie, goodnight to you"
165,Susans House,Eels,"Going over to Susan's house, walking south down Baxter Street
Nothing hiding behind this picket fence
There's a crazy old woman smashing bottles on the sidewalk
Where her house burnt down two years ago
People say that back then she really wasn't that crazy

Going over to Susan's house
Going over to Susan's house
She's gonna make it right

Down by the Donut Prince a fifteen year old boy lies on the sidewalk
With a bullet in his forehead
In a final act of indignity the paramedics take off all his clothes
For the whole world to see while they put him in the bag
Meanwhile and old couple argues inside the Queen Bee
The sick fluorescent light shimmering on their skin

Going over to Susan's house
Going over to Susan's house
I can't be alone tonight

Take a left down echo park, a kid asks do I want some crack
T.v. sets are spewing Baywatch through the windows into black
Here comes a girl with long brown hair who can't be more than seventeen
She sucks on a red popsicle while she pushes a baby girl in a pink carriage
And I'm thinking, that must be her sister
That must be her sister, right?
They go into the 7-11 and I keep walking

Going over to Susan's house [Repeat: x2]"
166,"In the Yard, Behind the Church",Eels,"In the yard, behind the church where
Butterflies and blackbirds search for
A safe place to rest the night away
We will go down to the brook and
Sit upon the overlook then
Forget about the troubles of the day

We will walk among the graves of
Men long dead with presidents' names and
Listen to the water flow softly by
I will kiss you on the lips now
And as the sky grows dark we'll strip down
And let the water wash away all lies

In the yard, behind the church where
Butterflies and blackbirds perch on
Grey stones as the garden's growing dim
We will lay down on the ground and
Put our cheeks against the dirt down
Where it no longer matters
Where you've been"
167,Kinda Fuzzy,Eels,"In my heart there lives a little riddle
I’m always trying to find my way
Everything is older in the morning
I’ll find an answer someday

But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the sunshine and bright
Don’t mess with me
I’m up for the fight

It’s a tangle cob web that I weave
The dusty room over naked mind
Anything that keeps the sun rising
I gotta see if I can find

But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the future looks bright
Don’t mess with me
I’m up for the fight

Riding through like an outlaw drifter
Never knowing which way to turn
In the morning I think I got it
It’s gone

Pull the curtains open wide
Gotta know that I’m about it
Good god it’s never dead don’t never doubt it
Yo I’m alright, I’m feeling kinda fuzzy

In my heart there lives a little riddle
I’m always trying to find my way
I don’t know what it’s gonna take me
I only need a little break man
I know you know that I’m a good man

But I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But you know I’m alright
I’m feeling kinda fuzzy
But the future looks bright
Don’t mess with me"
168,Rotten World Blues,Eels,"Well I went walking
Out yesterday
A man was carrying a sign that says
""the world is gonna end tomorrow""
Hey buddy, got a nickel I can borrow?

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
The sooner you recognize this simple fact
Then this rotten world gives you what you lack

Ol' Miss Headtrip
She's gettin' down
You don't see her much walking 'round town
Well you could say that she needs a little lovin'
Looking for a light with her head in the oven

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
The sooner you recognize this simple fact
Then this rotten world gives you what you lack

Miss Kovaleva
She's lookin' good
Walkin' her ass through the neighborhood
She knows something that you don't know
Something she learned about a long time ago

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out
The sooner you recognize this simple fact
Then this rotten world gives you what you lack

This rotten world's gonna chew you up
Swallow you whole and then spit you back out"
170,Rock Hard Times,Eels,"They told me that I couldn't come back here again
Took me for some kind of fool
Said I was doing things that never should be done
But I don't care about their rules

As if I cared 'bout the little minds
In the little heads of the herd
There's nothing you could dream
Would be more absurd

And everybody knows these are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times

I don't know what it is they're trying to do to me
Make me into some sick joke
But no one's laughing
And least of all not me
It's hard to laugh as you choke

Hollywood lies piled up to the sky
Floating your way soon
Hope you like the rotten stench of doom

And everybody knows these are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times

And everybody knows these are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times

I don't know what it is they think I'm gonna try
They don't know what they need to fear
The surest sign that the end is coming soon
Is right there in the bathroom mirror

Everybody knows these are rock hard times
I gotta make it through
These are rock hard times
These are rock hard times"
171,Premonition,Eels,"Rooms hold people
Year after year
Tenants come and go
The walls don't care if you're here

These walls are unforgiving
As the night is black
The world can be a real mean place
When no one's got your back

I had a premonition
It's all gonna be fine
You can kill or be killed
But the sun's gonna shine

I had a premonition
That we're gonna get by
You and I have a love
That never can die

It's not the weight you carry
It's how you carry it
We can get through anything
We can take the hit

I had a premonition
It's all gonna be fine
You can kill or be killed
But the sun's gonna shine

I had a premonition
That we're gonna get by
You and I have a love
That never can die

Sweetheart don't ever doubt
That my love is alive
You and I can really live
Much more than survive"
172,Three Speed,Eels,"Got a 3 speed and banana seat
Sitting back on the sissy bar
Went to sev and got a drink
Wish I was driving in daddy's car

And I looked up at the sky last night
And I thought I saw a bomb
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?

Riding down on springhill road
Meeting alfred out in the woods
Dogs bark and mosquitos bite
Scratching the itch that makes it feel good

And I looked at into the mirrot last night
All I saw was a pretty blonde
And why won't you tell me what's going on?

Life is funny
But not ha ha funny
Peculiar I guess
You think I got it all going my way
Then why am I such a fucking mess?

Want a pony and a birthday cake
Want a party with a scary clown
Kneel down and bow to the princess
Kneel down for the queen of the town

And I looked up at the sky last night
And I thought I saw a bomb
And why won't you tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on"
173,Teenage Witch,Eels,"Look at downtown
Sunrise of Sam
Bring it on down now
I'm in a jam
Where did you find such a rocking vest?
Said get away kid
You've become a pest

Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch

Silky gown
Pink and brown
Shut you down 
And shut you up

Little lizard legs and little lizard tails
Always taste better when you're sitting in jail
Still I don't think that I can resist
After all the turds that I had to kiss

Heaven can't help a teenage witch
From sinking deeper down into the ditch

Keeping arms length from the long arm law
Going to the bank for a fifty dollar draw
Gonna find the place where the werewolves hang
Knockin' on the door for a fifty dollar bang"
174,Hey Man (Now You're Really Living),Eels,"Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor
Cry your guts out 'til you got no more?
Hey man
Now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl?
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world (Hey!)
Hey man
Now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything (Sha la la la)
And you're really getting all you gave (Sha la la la)
Now you're really living what this life is all about

Well, I just saw the sun rise over the hill
Never used to give me much of a thrill (Hey!)
But hey man
Now I'm really living

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!

Do you know what it's like to care too much
'Bout someone that you're never gonna get to touch?
Hey man
Now you're really living

Have you ever sat down in the fresh-cut grass (Hey!)
And thought about the moment and when it will pass? (Hey!)
Hey man
Now you're really living

Now you're really giving everything (Sha la la la)
And you're really getting all you gave (Sha la la la)
Now you're really living what this life is all about

Now

Now what would you say if I told you that (Hey!)
Everyone thinks you're a crazy old cat? (Hey!)
Hey man
Now you're really living

Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor (Hey!)
Cry your guts out 'til you got no more? (Hey!)
Hey man
Now you're really living

Have you ever made love to a beautiful girl? (Hey!)
Made you feel like it's not such a bad world (Hey!)
Hey man
Now you're really living

People!

Do you know what it's like to fall on the floor (Sing!) (Hey!)
Cry your guts out 'til you got no more? (Hey!)

Never used to give me much of a thrill (Hey!)
Hey man
Now I'm really living!

Hey!
Hey!

People!

Hey!
Hey!
Hey!"
175,The Man,Eels,"Look in the mirror
I am the man
Mrs. Miller says
I am the man
Ask the birds singin'
I am the man
Everyone is a fan

A little walk through the neighborhood
People nod 'cause it's understood
Mr. Henry comes out to stand
A wave and shout-out
To the man

Ask the birds singin'
I am the man
By popular demand

The little skinhead with the tattooed face
Shows me a moment of style and grace
The old hippie with the tie-dye headband
Flashes a peace sign to the man

Ask the birds singin'
I am the man
Well, I do what I can

The angry redneck in his pickup truck
Tips his hat and gives the thumbs-up
The New Age guy with the yoga mat
Blesses me with a pat on the back
The long haired indie rock kid in a band
Looks through his hair and shakes my hand
The old homeless guy who smells like pee
Stops talking nonsense and says ""Morning, E""

Ask the birds singin'
I am the man
It's all part of the plan

The thug rapper with the gold and chains
Puts in his grill and says ""Good day""
The politician going door to door
Says ""No vote means more to me than yours""

Ask the birds singin'
I am the man
You know I'd win if I ran"
176,Estate Sale,Eels,"These are the sounds
Of days that are past

(A miracle was about to happen)"
177,I Want To Protect You,Eels,"Not much of a man
But still I am a man
And you bring out somethin inside me
A perfect little diamond
A fragile little fire
And everything good in the world
To me

I want to protect you
I want you to be safe and sound
At night in this world
Such a delicate girl needs someone
To look out for the wolves
I want to protect you

I say some stupid shit
Don't mean a word of it
You know I got a lot of love inside me
This world's an ugly place
For such a pretty face
They're comin at you from all sides
But they gotta get through me

I want to protect you
I want you to be safe and sound
At night in this world
Such a delicate girl needs someone
To look out for the wolves
I want to protect you

Not many understand
But I'm your biggest fan
The savage fools cannot appreciate
The miracle of you
How could it be true
You're everything good in the world

I want to protect you
I want you to be safe and sound
At night in this world
Such a delicate girl needs someone
To look out for the wolves
I want to protect you

I want to protect you

Fellas, just look at her (aww)
We gotta keep an eye out on her behalf (yeah)"
178,Taking a Bath in Rust,Eels,"Why don't you
Get me
A way out of here
Buy me a ticket
A seat in the rear

Cause I'd say the daylight
Its time to go home

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
'Get out of here'

I think that you know
Its not so bad
Sitting in rust and taking a bath

But I think that I could
Find a new way

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
'Get out of here'

Why don't you just think
About it a while
Maybe I'm too much
Cramping your style

But now that it's daylight
It's time to go home

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
'Get out of here'"
179,I Need Some Sleep,Eels,"I need some sleep
You can't go home like this
I try counting sheep
But there's one I always miss

Everyone says I'm getting down to low
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go

I need some sleep
Time to put the old horse down
I'm in too deep
And the wheels keep spinning round

Everyone says I'm getting down to low
Everyone says you just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go

You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go
You just gotta let it go"
180,Everything’s Gonna Be Cool This Christmas,Eels,"Remember last year when you were on your own
You swore the spirit couldn't be found
December rolled around and you were counting on it
To roll out

Well, everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas

Well everybody's lookin' for you down at the house
The tree is looking so inspired
There's a yuletide groove waitin' for you to move
I'll go and throw another log on the fire

Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas

As days go by the more we need friends
And the harder they are to find
If I could have a friend like you all my life
Well I guess I'd be doin' just fine

Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas
Everything's gonna be cool this christmas"
181,What I Have To Offer,Eels,"What I have to offer
Well, there's a lot
Now I'm a modest man
But look at all I got

For all the wear and tear
I look OK
I got good manners
And I make good good pay

And you know I'm all full of love
For you

What I have to offer
Well, there's so much
I care and nurture and a
Tender touch

I got a pleasin' disposition
And I don't care about
Football or fishin'

And you know that I'm all full of love
For you

What I have to offer
Well, check it out
I've learned some things
And I know what it's about

I'm quite discerning and
I'm pretty smart
It takes an awful lot to
Win my heart

But you know that I'm so full of love
For you"
182,Novocaine For the Soul,Eels,"Life is hard
And so am I
You'd better give me something
So I don't die
Novocaine for the soul
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

Life is white
And I am black
Jesus and his lawyer
Are coming back
Oh my darling
Will you be here
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

Guess who's living here with the great undead
This paint by numbers life is fucking with my head, once again

Life is good
And I feel great
'Cause mother says I was
A great mistake
Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me something to fill the hole
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out"
183,My Descent Into Madness,Eels,"Springfield's looking pretty dusty today
I see their dreams coming undone
The view from inside ward nine affords this much
A town teeming with the unloved
Close the window and lock it so it's good and tight

Turning eighteen and trying not to look too lost
Have a not so nice day
The jacket makes me straight so I can just sit back and bake
You know I think I'm gonna stay
Talking very loud but no one hears a word I say

Come visit me tonight at eight o'clock and then 
You'll see how I am not the crazy one
Voices tell me I'm the shit

Twenty days go by and every day looks the same

I'm the shit"
184,Agatha Chang,Eels,"Agatha was beautiful
Her long, black hair and aching eyes
Even when she didn't feel so good
She look alright
She always had her smile
And it was good for a while

I wouldn't answer each time the phone rang
But I should've stayed with agatha chang

Agatha, she wasn't mean
She didn't cheat, she never lied
Even if she disagreed with you
It wasn't a fight
Made you feel like you're both right
But then I lost sight

I couldn't bear to break up my old gang
But I should've stayed with agatha chang

What was so important then?
I haven't a clue
How could I have been so blind and cruel?

Agatha, where did you go?
Do I have the slightest chance?
I could make up for everything that I did wrong
But I know it's just a song
And you're probably long gone

Forgot all about her each night that I sang
But I should've stayed with agatha chang"
185,Ugly Love,Eels,"Dear cousin,
I got your letter
It was more than I thought I deserved
Well she sounds perfect, all I dream of
And I dream about so much it is absurd
But when I get there and she sees me
I'll be impressed if she does not run screaming

My kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time

I had a thought while I was sleeping
And I dreamed about a place for us to rest
Eternity under the old oak tree
But I go too far I guess
Maybe I'll think about tomorrow
And maybe I can get her to stay that long

'Cause my kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time

And if she finds me repulsive
She wouldn't be the first to wretch
Well I decided one day long ago
I was never gonna be the greatest catch
And if she cares about the car I drive
Then she can get in hers
The moment I arrive

'Cause my kind of love is an ugly love
But it's real and it lasts a long, long time"
186,Poor Side of Town,Eels,"How can you tell me how much you miss me
When the last time I saw you, you wouldn't even kiss me
That rich guy you've been seein'
Must have put you down
So welcome back baby
To the poor side of town

To him you were nothin' but a little plaything
Not much more than an overnight fling
To me you were the greatest thing this boy had ever found
And girl it's hard to find nice things
On the poor side of town

I can't blame you for tryin'
I'm tryin' to make it too
I've got one little hang up baby
I just can't make it without you

So tell me, are you gonna stay now
Will you stand by me girl all the way now
Oh with you by my side
They just can't keep us down
Together we can make it girl
From the poor side of town

(So tell me how much you love me)
(Come be near to me and say you need me now)

Oh, with you by my side
This world can't keep us down
Together we can make it baby
From the poor side of town"
187,Steam Engine,Eels,"Well
Chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga chuga

Steam engine
Rollin' down the tracks
Station bell ringin'
Gotta hurry back
Steam engine
Runnin' outta steam
Go out with a bang now
Do you know what I mean?

My daddy drank it black and so do I
Another day, another coffee and the years go by
Too much lemon, not enough honey
Makes baby grumpy baby with a grudge to feed

Steam engine (steam engine)
Rollin' down the tracks (rollin' down the tracks)
Station bell ringin'
(Gotta hurry back) gotta hurry back
Steam engine (steam engine)
Running outta steam (running outta steam)
Go out with a bang now
Oh man, what a scream

Sister said she's comin', she won't let me down
She knows my days are numbered and she wrote the number down
Always had it for me, so get it here soon
Man, we're gonna dance, just look at her move
Watch her move
Says I like it like that
Oh, she does

Steam engine (steam engine)
Rollin' down the tracks (rollin' down the tracks)
Station bell ringin'
(Gotta hurry back) gotta hurry back
Steam engine (steam engine)
Runnin' outta steam (runnin' outta steam)
Go out with a bang now
Yeah, that would be scream
See my engine gleam"

Win my heart

But you know that I'm so full of love
For you"
189,It’s a Motherfucker,Eels,"It's a motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls
Just me again
But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same

It's a motherfucker
How much I understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand
And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same"
190,Trouble with Dreams,Eels,"There's nothing that I want to do
More than get alone and be with you
Trouble with dreams is they don't come true
And when they do they can't catch up to you

You don't need a thing from me
But I need something big from you
'Cause you know I've got an awful lot of big dreams

I'm walking down a lonely road
Clear to me now but I was never told
Trouble with dreams is you never know
When to hold on and when to let go

If you let me down it's alright
At least that leaves something for me
'Cause you know I've got an awful lot of big dreams

This is the life that I must lead now
Crossing fingers and wiping brow
Trouble with dreams is you can't pretend
Something with no beginning has no end

You don't need a thing from me
But I need something big from you
'Cause you know I've got an awful lot of big dreams"
191,"Oh, What a Beautiful Morning",Eels,"There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye
And it looks like it's climbing clear up in the sky

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way

All the cattle are standin' like statues
All the cattle are standin' like statues
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by
But a little brown maverick is winkin' her eye

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way

All the sounds of the earth are like music
All the sounds of the earth are like music
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree
And an old weepin' willer is laughin' at me

Oh, what a beautiful mornin'
Oh, what a beautiful day
I got a beautiful feelin'
Everything's goin' my way"
193,Feeling Good,Eels,"Fish in the sea, you know how I feel
River runnin' free you know how I feel
Blossom on the tree you know how I feel
Its a new dawn, its a new day, its a new life for me
And I'm feelin good

Dragonfly in the sun you know what I mean
Butterflies all havin' fun you know what I mean
Sleepin' peace when day is done that's what I mean
And this old world is a new world and a bold world for me

Stars when you shine you know how I feel
Scent of the crime you know how I feel
Your freedom is mine, and I know how I feel
Its a new dawn, its a new day, its a new life for me
And I'm feelin good"
194,On the Ropes,Eels,"Every time I find myself in this old bind
Watching the death of my hopes.
In the ring so long gonna prove them wrong
I'm not knocked out, but I'm not on the ropes

I've got enough I left inside this tired heart
to win this world and walk on my feet, know the trip

I may never get, everything I bet
but I'm a man who always copes
I'm hurting bad, and fight em at
I'm not knocked out, but I'm not on the ropes

Everything that I hold me didn't mean
'cause riding on this moment here and now, I know how

I've got enough I left inside this tired heart
to win this world and walk on my feet, no defeat

Gonna feel so good, when it's understood
but hold the rebirth of my hopes
In the ring so long gotta prove them wrong
I'm not knocked out, but I'm not on the ropes"
195,It's A Beautiful Day,Eels,"The smoke stack spittin' black soot into the sooty sky
the load on the road brings a tear to the indian's eye
the elephant wont forget what its like i..."
196,There I Said It,Eels,"You're gun shy
So am I
I understand with what you've been through

Why you wouldn't want to give it all away
Tender hearts masquerading
As badasses in training

You can drop the act
I won't attack
I love you
There, I said it

Funny girl
And funny guy
Just trying to laugh instead of cry

There's nothing funny about who you are to me
A pure heart needs protection
Sweet love and affection

Don't be afraid
I'm just gonna say it
I love you
There, I said it"
197,Sweet Scorched Earth,Eels,"I love the way your hair falls on your eyes
And the way the sun hits them as it dies
There's poison in the water and the sky
We'll hold onto each other if we fry

It's you and me forever, together
For all that it's worth
As long as we last on this sweet, scorched Earth

I love that you're my best friend and my wife
And I love our little family and our life
There's poison in the hearts of cheerless men
I only want to see it come to an end

It's you and me forever, together
For all that it's worth
As long as we last on this sweet, scorched Earth"
198,Good Night On Earth,Eels,"Once upon a time, mom and dad felt fine
Thought it was time for a birth
Ever since then the trouble never ends
But it's a good night on earth

Getting up and going is a sweet lament
Doing what you gotta do is all you got
Gather up the things and run to the void
Remember what you been taught
Soak it all in like tonic and gin
Everything for what it's worth
Is relative, but look, my friend
It's a good night on earth

Once upon a time, I was feeling fine
And you know that time is now
Nothing gonna wreck it, you know I can't deflect it
I always do so now
Everyone's a critic, I can't stand Eels
So says Colin Firth
Rain on my parade, then the clouds fade
It's a good night on earth"
200,Eyes Down,Eels,"Well, the sun is shining but it don't feel good
Don't smile down on this neighborhood
When I go walking through this stinking town
Mister, I keep my eyes down

The brotherhood of the misunderstood
Live and die here in all likelihood
You're livin' in this town
Better pray for sundown

And baby, when you go downtown
You keep your eyes down
You keep your eyes down

Fair-weather friends need not apply
The man of the house is not inside
Baby, I'm keeping my eyes down

Go with the flow, well, you've gotta be sick
Think I'd rather hear my heart not tick
But if you don't wanna wear a hospital gown
Better get out now or keep your eyes down

Fair-weather friends need not apply
The man of the house is not inside
Baby, I'm keeping my eyes down

Well, the sun is shining but it don't feel good
Don't smile down on this neighborhood
When I go walking through this stinking town
Mister, I keep my eyes down, I keep my eyes down"
201,Apple Trees,Eels,"We were on this car trip, 
And I was looking at these rows and rows of trees all along the highway. 
I don't know what kind of trees, 
Apples or something. 
There were just like thousands 
And thousands of rows of a thousand trees each. 

And I picked one tree that 
I could see about eight trees back in this one row in the middle. 
Just one in a billion. 
And that's how I felt."
202,Jeannie’s Diary,Eels,"How does her world spin
Without me in her nest?
Could there really be such happiness?

Oh, she's got a dark side too
Even murderous
But I love that
Just like her

I don't have a chance at writing the book
I just want to be a page
In Jeannie's diary
One single page
In Jeannie's diary

Yes I am intense
Maybe quite obsessed
Everything she does is curious

Oh, she's going to let me in
I just know it's so
Then again, who do I kid?

I don't have a prayer for writing the book
I just want to be a page
In Jeannie's diary
One single page
In Jeannie's diary

She could have anything she wants
So why not me?
She could have anything she dreams
Oh, to be one single page
One single page
In Jeannie's diary"
203,New Alphabet,Eels,"You know what?
I'm in a good mood today
Well I'm so happy
It's not yesterday
Man it was brutal
With glad use of tissues
I guess you could say
That I had issues

But it's looking good
I've dug my way out
I'm changing up
What the story's about

When the world stops making sense
Just taking what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet

Small thinking people
With their small thinking ways
I don't have time
To hear what they say
This is my world
I'm staking my claim
Thanks for the invite
No thanks just the same

It's looking good now
Full speed ahead
I'll live today
Like tomorrow I'm dead

When the world stops making sense
Just taking what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet

I see, everything
Is crystal clear
It's here

You know what?
I'm in a good mood today
Well I'm so happy
It's not yesterday
Man it was brutal
But it's all in the past
It's good to know it don't have to last

When the world stops making sense
Just taking what you can get
When the people on the street
Start looking like silhouettes
When the words just sound like noise
I need a new alphabet
When the world stops making sense
I make a new alphabet"
204,Souljacker Part I,Eels,"Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah

Johnny don't like the teacher
Johnny don't like the school
One day Johnny is going to do somethin'
Show 'em he's nobody's fool
Oh yeah

[Chorus:]
Sisters brothers make better lovers
Family affairs down under the covers...
Trailer parks the broken hearts
Won't let you leave until you're bleeding

Sally don't like her daddy
Sally don't like her friends
Sally and Johnny watchin' TV
Waitin' for it to end
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

Twenty two miles of hard road
Thirty three years of tough luck
Forty four skulls buried in the ground
Crawling down through the muck
Oh yeah"
205,All in a Day's Work,Eels,"When I was born
The doctor said
There's something wrong
Inside that baby head
When I was a boy
In Sunday school
I told them all
That they were fools

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
And so it goes

I went into
The fortune teller's
She wouldn't read
My horoscope
I go into
The laundromat
The people all
Buy extra soap

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see"
206,Your Lucky Day in Hell,Eels,"Mama grapped onto the milkman's hand
And then she finally gave birth
Years go by still I don't know
Who shall inherit this earth
And no one will know my name until it's on a stone

This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell

Waking up with an ugly face
Winston Churchill in drag
Looking for a new maternal embrace
Another tired old gag
Am I just a walking bag of chewed up dust and bones

This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell

Father Theresa you can't make me into you
I never want to be like you
Why can't you see it's me
You know it's time to let me go

This could be your lucky day in hell
Never know who it might be at your doorbell
This could be your lucky day in hell"
207,Who You Say You Are,Eels,"For some time now
Been alright on my own
Given the options
I'd rather be alone

Then you came along
And turned it upside down
And now I need to know
Just what it is I found

Are you who you say you are?
Someone I'll know for long
Or someone who doesn't deserve a song

Charming accents
Mask ugly things
There's not a lot I know about
What you stand to bring

And maybe it's all okay
And maybe I'm being unfair
But I learned the hard way
To be prepared

Are you who I think you are?
Someone I'll know for long
Or someone who doesn't deserve a song"
208,My Beloved Monster,Eels,"My beloved monster and me
We go everywhere together
Wearing a raincoat that has four sleeves
It gets us through all kinds of weather

[Chorus]
She will always be the only thing
That comes between me and the awful sting 
That comes from living in a world that's so damn mean

My beloved monster is tough
if she wants she will destroy you
but if you lay her down for a kiss
her little heart it could explode

[Chorus]"
209,Vice President Fruitley,Eels,"Vice President Fruitley
Vice President Fruitley
C'mon to where you need to go
Vice President Fruitley

I think you know where I'm goin'
This song is all about you
I wanna be with you
Every day and night
'Cause I say...

Vice President Fruitley
I think you know what to wear
Vice President Fruitley
I'm really glad you're not square
Vice President Fruitley
Oh, come on, baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby
I really think that maybe we could go

210,Hidden Track,Eels,"so you've got balls now
marie on the run
down on newberry street
seventeen seconds of fun

apes are overrated, blucky
a kinky batch of pudding, yay!
garbage dump pumpkin rot
and candy apple gray

werewolf in a flower bed
perfect day for lucky guy
this song was never meant to be released
what's that flaming ball in the sky?

the crack head from texas
he can read my feet
a bruised pinata
and a liquid pixie

if friends were flowers
nothing gold can stay
consexual sense
and squeegee tales

bees in the cookie jar
symphonic despair
reinventing the manifesto
i, you, we ... don't care

jacuzzi's and bunnies
a broken fondue set
koool g is in the outhouse
you can be my mr. french

this old frisbee
is shitting in the alley
i saw a naked picture of me on the internet
wearing jesus's new snowshoes
golly gee

if hell is crowded, then we shall sing
a hip song for the kids in the back
for michele & the dripping of a faucet
ride the vicious bicycle on the tracks

olympic mayonnaise, dr. thunder!
low occupancy vehicle stops and starts
with hollywood suspicion
the doctor had snake parts"
211,Love Of The Loveless,Eels,"Don't got a lot of time
Don't give a damn
Don't tell me what to do
I am the man
If there's a god up there
Something above
God, shine your light down here
Shine on the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless

Don't have too many friends
Never felt at home
Always been my own man
Pretty much alone
I know how to get through
And when push comes to shove
I got something that you need
I got the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
For love of the loveless

All around you people walking
Empty hearts and voices talking
Looking for and finding
Nothing

Don't got a lot of time
Don't really care
Not selling anything
Buyer beware
If there's a god up there
Something above
God, shine your light down here
Shine on the love
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
For love of the loveless

Don't got a lot of time
Don't give a damn
Don't tell me what to do
I am the man
Love of the loveless
Love of the loveless
For love of the loveless
Love of the loveless"
212,Today Is the Day,Eels,"Today is the day that I chuck
Everything I thought out the door
Today is the day I ask myself
What the hell was I living for, that's right

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here

I thought about it, and it's kinda strange
Everything that I tried so hard
I thought about it and I gotta say
I had it wrong right from the start, that's right

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here
Come on man, and don't you worry now

Everything that I thought that I believed
Oh baby, was all so clear to me
But now I know that I was wrong
It's gone, it's gone, gone, gone
It's alright now

Today is the day that you see me
As a man who will always change
Who knows the only things to count on
Are life is quick, and life is strange, that's right

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here
Come on man, and don't you worry now

Today is the day it starts right here
Don't gotta thing to worry about now
Today is the day it starts right here
Come on man, and don't you worry now

I don't know if you'll come along
I just wanted to sing my song about change
Today is the day"
213,"Wonderful, Glorious",Eels,"The sum of all your experiences 
A living breathing result of the fight
And every night you spent shrouded in darkness
Has led you to this moment in the light, it's alright

Wonderful 
Glorious 
Wonderful 
Glorious 

Ah ah ah ah, ah ah 

Wonderful 
Glorious 

The sum of all the love inside your heart 
Will get you through your plight, it's alright

Wonderful 
Glorious 

My love is beautiful it's here for the taking
It's strong and pure and utterly earth shaking 
My love has brought me here to show you it's true 
A wretch like me, you make it through"
214,Rags to Rags,Eels,"There's a spider crawling on the bathroom mirror
Right on top of my right eye
And I can't stop staring back
How did I get this way?
Take a big look at a living lie

Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to riches was a bust

Sometimes I dream about it what it's like back home
The railroad tracks and the pussy willow
But I had to leave it and I go back
Whenever my tired head hits the pillow

Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to riches was a bust

Busted once again
But I'll show them one day
That I can buy and sell the world

One day I'll come through with my American dream
But it won't mean a fucking thing

Rags to rags and rust to rust
How do you stand when you've been crushed?
So rags to rags and rust to rust (don't let me go)
Rags to rags and rust to rust (don't let me go)
Rags to rags and rust to rust (don't let me go)"
215,Baby Genius,Eels,"Baby genius
Look how you've grown
Where do you go from here?
Didn't we have some good times
After all is said and done?

Small body and small mind
Big head and big headaches
My back is broken
Baby genius
Find a new ride"
216,I Write the B-Sides,Eels,"I write the B-sides
That make a small portion of the world cry
I like the seaside
And singing songs that make you not wanna die
Throw a stone into the sea
And wait for it to come back to me
Better get out on the boat
Cause someone told me that stones don't float

I like to sit out back
And look up at the squirrels in the trees
They don't like radio tracks
And they don't ever talk down to me
Throw a nod up in the tree (?)
Gonna fall right back on me
Well these guys know who they are
And what they need's in their own backyard

Oooh oooh

I like to flay in snow
I stick my hand in, now where did it go
It might be mighty cold
But that's all part of not doing what you're told"
217,Blinking Lights (For Me),Eels,"Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees
Blinking down a morse code signal
Especially for me

Ain't no rainbow in the sky
In the middle of the night
But the signal's coming through
One day I will be alright again

Blinking lights on the highway cars
Stopping one by one
Get a look at the accident
Didn't see that one coming

And the doctor in the sky
Gonna bring his chopper down
Gonna bring me out alive
And set me on the ground
Once more again

Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees"
218,Efil's God,Eels,"Efils good and the time is right
I'll bundle up and slip away
The count is down and the drip is up
It's time to split this hunk of clay

Now you can bring my suitcase
But you can't bring me
And you can have all the money
Cause you say that you must
But if you think that it matters
Take a look at me
And don't close your eyes as i turn into dust

Efils good
Don't tell me that i can't do this
As if you knew
But you don't know
How Efils good"
219,Unhinged,Eels,"You need help, baby, you've come unhinged
It's clear to everybody, you're on the fringe
Thought I'd stay until I died
But the twinkle in your eye is gone
And now all that's left is a mean old girl behind 
Your crazy eyes

We were good together, as good as it gets
I only wanted to help you from the day we met
And I'm sleeping on the couch for months on end
You were more than my girl
You were my best friend
All that's left is a mean old girl behind 
Her crazy eyes

I defy you to defy me
In your crazy state
You don't which way is up
And it's way too late
To ever fix all of the things
That you did break
Not least of which
Is my heart"
221,This is Where It Gets Good,Eels,"With a lustful admiration
I look upon you
Can't wait until tomorrow
The things that we'll do

And this
Is where
It gets good

Permission to speak freely?
Well, I really must confess
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Gettin' out of your dress

And this
Is where
It gets good

The sky in your eyes
The earth in your touch
The spirits come together
Well, it's almost too much

And this
Is where
It gets good"
222,Are You Fucking Your Ex,Eels,"Where were you when I called last night?
Disappeared, we didn't even have a fight
My love is strange
Everything feels broken now
Don't know for sure, just know some how
My love it's done

I'm all alone in a house of horror
Evil lurks from the darkest corner
My heart is black
I get it, everyone likes sex
But I need to know
Just what is going on the late night's out
The days you disappear, I have to ask
Are you fucking your ex?

Where were you when I called last night?
Disappeared, we didn't even have a fight
My love, so strange
I get it, everyone likes sex
But I need to know
Just what is going on the late night's out
The days you disappear, I have to ask
Are you fucking your ex?
Are you fucking your ex?
Are you fucking your ex?
My love, so strange"
225,I Got Hurt,Eels,"It's a sore subject
That I'd rather not address
How did I get here
Into such an ugly mess
Got myself carried away
Despite all common sense
How could I be so dense

I got hurt
Oh yeah
And it didn't feel good

I got hurt, oh my Lord
And I got hurt good

It's a good day when 
I know there's not a chance
For anyone or anything
To mess with my stance

Let the time pass the way
I need for it to pass
If you need me don't ask

I got hurt
Oh yeah
And it didn't feel good

I got hurt, oh my Lord
And I got hurt good
And I'm never going back
That scene has gone to black
There's no way to make me see
What I was will never be

It's a sore subject
But it has to be addressed
All of the destruction 
Well it needs to be assessed
Let myself get away
Although the odds were bad
How did I get so sad

I got hurt
Oh yeah
And it didn't feel good

I got hurt, oh my Lord
And I got hurt good"
226,The Bright Side,Eels,"Shut up, you don't have to shout it
It's fucked up if you think about it too long
Feelin' like I'm all used up
Half empty, it's a broken cup, that's all
You little fool, you could be happy
Come take my hand, we'll go for a ride
Shut up, you don't have to remind me
It's not enough to fully blind me from it
Feeling like a stupid asshole
Take me now, if this is it this sucks
You little fool, you could be happy
Come take my hand, we'll go for a ride
Look up ahead, off in the distance
The sun is shining on the bright side"
227,Eight Lives Left,Eels,"eight lives left
one chapter down
still nothing new
in this old town


i'd like to spend at least
one life with you
eight lives left
and a heart that ..."
228,Your Mama Warned You,Eels,"Your mama warned you, she was probably right 
Said I be trouble all day and all night 
She said my kind is not to take an old kind 
She told them better was out there to find 
Your mama warned you and she doesn’t needs words 
A life with him high that’s for the birds 
She said you listen and you take it from me 
You just can’t be what he needin to be 
But you can’t believe everything she says 
There’s a home called heaven within my head 
You know that I mean well 

Your mama warned you with an arrogant tone 
Don’t be a fool girl leave him alone 
She so superior and so she just think 
But I don’t trust someone who’s eyes never blink 
No, you can’t believe everything she says 
There’s a home called heaven within my head 
You know that I mean well 

All the things she’ll never understand 
I’ll know she’ll never be a fan 
But she’s not you 

Your mama warned you, she was probably right 
Said I be trouble all day and all night 
She said my kind is not to take an old kind 
She told them better was out there to find 
And you can’t believe everything she says 
There’s a home called heaven within my head 
You know that I mean well 
Your mama warned you."
229,The Beginning,Eels,"She put on her party dress
I put on my jacket
We walked out the door
Didn't have nowhere to go
Didn't matter that the night was getting cold

Pulled her close up to me to keep her warm
And everything was beautiful and free
In the beginning

She woke up late in the morning
I pulled the curtain back
The sun came pouring in
There wasn't no one in the world
There wasn't nothing else
Just me and my girl

She put her arms around me
Gave me a kiss
And everything was beautiful and free
In the beginning"
230,Nowadays,Eels,"Nowadays I keep to myself
Everybody else can look some other way
Things I say seem to get me into trouble
That I've been through for too many days

And trouble is a friend of mine
I'd like to leave behind
I like my friends more refined

Things I lose
Weighing on my heart
Every time I start to think
Maybe it's through

A little lie
Goes a long way when you can't say
Quite for sure what's the truth
The truth is something no one really
Wants to hear you say
Just how you doin' and have a nice day

Nowadays you go for a walk
Better not stop and wave or say hello

Just this song
People will spit, give you shit
Just for looking at them
And walking too slow

Slowly and methodically
I'll lock the world away
Haunted by my better days"
231,Be Hurt,Eels,"I know, you made a big mistake
You left a lot of damage
Floating in the wake
Though your actions were unwise
You'll still see the sunrise

Be hurt
The world can take it
And so can you
Come on, be hurt
You know that you can take it
I'm not gonna let it destroy you

Look here, you're more than your mistakes
It's just how it goes sometimes
Your heart may have to break
Though it feels like it's the end
You can't see around the bend

Be hurt
The world can take it
And so can you
Come on, be hurt
You know that you can take it
I'm not gonna let it destroy you

I know, you think you've lost your way
You need a lot of courage
To face another day
As you stumble through the night
Know you're gonna win the fight

Come on, be hurt
The world can take it
And so can you
I know it I do
Come on, be hurt
You know that you can take it
I'm not gonna let it destroy you
Come on, be hurt
It's alright
I'm not gonna let it destroy you"
233,Dust of Ages,Eels,"This is the day
That I give myself up

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And so you shake your cloak off
And get on your way

Bloodshot and trembling
A new day has begun

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
And you blow it all away
And get on your way

The dust of ages
Settles on your days
But I'm not fuckin' around anymore
I'm on my way"
234,P.S. You Rock My World,Eels,"I was at a funeral the day I realized
I wanted to spend my life with you
Sitting doen on the steps at the old post office
The flag was flying at half-mast
And I was thinkin' 'bout how everyone is dying
And maybe it's time to live

I don't know where we're going
I don't know what we'll do

Walked in to the Thrif-tee
Saw the man with the hollow eyes who didn't give me all the change
But it didn't bother me this time 'cause I know I've only got this moment
I went to the gas station
Old woman honked her horn
Waiting for me to fix her car

I don't know where we're going
I don't know what we'll do

Laying in bed tonight I was thinking
And listening to all the dogs
And the sirens and the shots
And how a careful man tries
To dodge the bullets
While a happy man takes a walk

And maybe it's time to live"
236,All In a Day’s Work,Eels,"When I was born
The doctor said
There's something wrong
Inside that baby head
When I was a boy
In Sunday school
I told them all
That they were fools

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
And so it goes

I went into
The fortune teller's
She wouldn't read
My horoscope
I go into
The laundromat
The people all
Buy extra soap

All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see
All in a day's work
To live and breathe
A sight to see"
237,After the Operation,Eels,"After the operation
I was in a lotta pain
But I look fondly on it
Just passin' all the days in a haze
Layin' on the couch
And watchin' TV
After the operation
I didn't have a care
I'd spend whole afternoons

Just layin' there
While I stared
At things in the room
That made me think
After the operation
I ate a lotta junk
I'd drift off and fall asleep
And have these little dreams
Where I'm feeling
Back to my old self again"
240,Bone Dry,Eels,"In my dream, I see you there
Your eyes fixed in a vacant stare
A little laugh, a crooked smile
Don't lift a finger while I lay dying

Bone dry
You drank all the blood
My heart is bone dry
Can't give you more 'cause you took all of it (Sha la la)

Was a day when I did believe
The things you say are what you mean
Dear sweet, innocent me
How much you took from me to finally see

Bone dry
You drank all the blood
My heart is bone dry
Can't give you more 'cause you took all of it (sha la la, sha la la)

Sha la la
Shouby dooby dooby doo
Shouby dooby
Shouby dooby dooby doo

What becomes a man like me
Drifting off, lost at see
I'll set a fire look up for it
Lookin' for me, I'm a pink sunset

Bone dry (sha la la)
You drank all the blood
My heart is bone dry (sha la la)
Can't give you more 'cause you took all of it (Sha la la)

Bone dry, who!
(Sha la la) bone dry, whoo!
You took all of it (sha la la)
Sha la la
Sha la la

Sha la la"
242,Peach Blossom,Eels,"Oh man, feel so nice
That was a long cold night
But then the sun came out to thaw the ice

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Oh look at her, she’s got something to say
And I cant wait to hear it
Won’t let her get away

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Oh yeah, oh my goodness
You gonna love what’s happening in here
There ain’t nothing for me to fear

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold

Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold
Open the window man to smell the peach blossom
The tiger lily, the merry-gold"
243,A True Original,Eels,"She’s a true original
Not some store bought rebel
She can find her own way and whom
You’ll just have to let her

Whichever every path she finds 
It’s hers to take
And if she says she’s fine
I’ll just have to wait for her

She’s an artist in the world
She composes from the heart
The finish on he’s always there
Well before she starts

And any time she might
Get the words from
You just turn it up and you
You sing along with her

And if a gun was pointed at her
I would stand between the bullet and her
And if not being with me is what makes her happy
I’d take that bullet too

Whichever every path she finds 
It’s hers to take
And if she says she’s fine
I’ll just have to wait for her

She’s a true original"
244,Manchild,Eels,"And every time you crave for me, 
I'm here.

And anything you hunger for,
I'll share.

And I will be quietly standing by,
While slowly I am dying inside.

Hold me in your arms,
And let me be the one who can feel,
Like I am a child in love.

Every time I talk to you,
You're down.

And every time you need a laugh,
I'm around.

And when you forget I'm here,
I'm not.
It isn't really me that you forgot.

Hold me in your arms,
And let me be the one who can feel,
Like I am a child in love.

Whisper now,
And tell me how,
You watch and tell me,
Somehow, 
I'm gonna be alright."
245,Something Is Sacred,Eels,"Taking a walk down to the mall
Smelling piss and beer and gas
That could be me in a couple years
Suckin' fumes under the highway pass

On a rainy day
While I wear newspapers for pants
And a T-shirt that says "" Damn I'm good ""

People look funny when they cry
'Cause they just can't let it hide
Typing into your little box
Press the cry button
It unlocks

On a rainy day
No one has a thing to say
Easier to look the other way

Take a look in the killer's eyes
And you see there's nothing there
But something is sacred in your eyes
And something to believe

On a rainy day
And as the world will blow to bits
I'll cradle you and hold you tight"
246,My Timing Is Off,Eels,"My timing is off
She isn't ready for my love
It's all that I got
But it's a pretty big thing
That she should recognize
The truth between us cannot hide

She knows that it's real
But the situation doesn't fit
I know what I feel

And I know that this is really
Everything it's all about
And I don't have a single doubt

My timing is off
But sometimes that's how it all works
Believe it or not
We don't have a choice
In matters of the heart

Just gotta be brave enough
To love and let yourself be loved
My timing is off
And I'm not worried 'bout a thing

She knows that it's real
She couldn't throw it all away
For fear of happiness
This isn't like that other mess"
247,Saturday Morning,Eels,"Saturday morning
Who's gonna play with me?
Six in the morning, baby
I got a long, long day ahead of me

The parents are sleeping soundly
The neighbors are dead as wood
I'm getting up and coming over
We gotta rock the neighborhood

Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day if you want to
But I got something that I gonna do

It's Saturday morning
And this ain't the place for me
I'm giving you warning, baby
We got a whole big, fat world to see

Nothing's ever gonna happen 'round here
If we don't make it happen
Sleep away the day if you want to
But I got something that I gonna do

It's Saturday morning
And who's gonna play with me?
Six in the morning, baby
I got a long, long day ahead of me

Saturday morning
Saturday morning"
248,Altar Boy,Eels,"A monk with a hard-on
And a lavender robe
That scratches his thighs
Through the hat that he strode
As he follows a path
Filled with every desire
And mimics his footsteps
And sets his prayers on fire.

Well I too have chosen
That which left no choice
To sing without loving,
A solitary voice,
To observe with passion
Each careful denial:
The protrusions which give my life meaning
For a while.

Sometimes I see you in berries and weeds
You're brushing your teeth with liquorice seeds
Standing too close,
Pulling your clothes,
Smiling at god
And the meaning of life grows.

No and I'll never tell
And I'll never know
What candles you light
After the show
And I'll never tell,
And I'll never ask
The meaning of life after mass."
249,Jehovah's Witness,Eels,"jehovah's witness leave me alone
jehovah's witness i'm not at home
keep on a-knockin' and ringin' the bells
knockin' your way straight to hell


jehovah's witness let's not pretend
that for one second you are my friend
knock on my door and i'll turn out the light
close the curtains and turn in for the night


jehovah's witness why must it be

like i'm some old lady who'll give up her loot


jehovah's witness leave me alone
jehovah's witness i'm not at home"
250,If I Was Your Girlfriend,Eels,"Look at the bargains over here, ladies... If I was your girlfriend
Would you remember
2 tell me all the things you forgot when I was your man?
When I was your man If I was your best friend
Would you let me take care of you
And do all the things that only a best friend can
Only best friends can If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend If I was your girlfriend
Would you let me dress you

Before we go out Not that you're helpless
But sometime, sometime

Please If I was your girlfriend
If I was your girlfriend Would you let me wash your hair
Could I make you breakfast sometime

Could we go 2 a movie and cry together

Baby can I dress you

Maybe you think I'm being a little self-centered (If I was your girlfriend)
But I, I said I want 2 be (Sugar)
All of the things you are 2 me (Sugar) (If I was your girlfriend)
Surely, surely you can see Is it really necessary 4 me 2 go out of the room
Just because you wanna undress? (If I was your girlfriend)
We don't have 2 make children 2 make love
And we don't have 2 make love 2 have an orgasm (If I was your girlfriend) Your body's what I'm all about (If I was your girlfriend)

I'll show you (If I was your girlfriend)
Why not?
You can do it because I'm your friend

Of course I'll undress in front of you! (If I was your girlfriend)
And when I'm naked, what shall I do?
How can I make you see that it's cool? (If I was your girlfriend)
Can't you just trust me?
If I was your girlfriend you could (If I was your girlfriend)
Oh, yeah, I think so
Listen, 4 you naked I would dance a ballet (If I was your girlfriend)
Would that get you off?
Then tell me what will!
If I was your girlfriend, would you tell me? (If I was your girlfriend)
Would you let me see you naked then?
Would you let me give you a bath?
Would you let me tickle you so hard you'd laugh and laugh (If I was your girlfriend)
And would you, would you let me kiss you there (If I was your girlfriend)
You know down there where it counts (If I was your girlfriend)
I'll do it so good I swear I'll drink every ounce
And then I'll hold you tight and hold you long (If I was your girlfriend) And together we'll stare into silence
And we'll try 2 imagine what it looks like
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what, what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try 2 imagine what silence looks like
Yeah, we'll try..."
252,Birdgirl On a Cell Phone,Eels,"She has eyes disability blue
A German dog and strict curfew
And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she's turned the script to another page
And she doesn't really give a damn
What you have to say

She makes a call on her friend's cell phone
The operator answers and says ""You're not alone""
And if one man's ceiling is another's dance floor
Then she'll be the one running to the sea shore
Trying to tell the seagulls
This is home

And if one man's cage is another man's stage
Then she'll be the one wiser than her age
Trying to get the message to your ear"
253,I'm Your Brave Little Soldier,Eels,"Things were good for a, couple of minutes
But now it’s one hard faith
The super marking card makes you home
I push it by myself

I’m your brave little soldier
And everything will be alright
I’m your brave little soldier
Coming home to you tonight
Gonna be alright

Stand in line at the playboy rigor
Ski mask yawning at my face
Laying on the floor, thinking how I 
Forgot to pray last night

I’m your brave little soldier
And everything will be alright
I’m your brave little soldier
Coming home to you tonight
Gonna be alright

It’s money in the cup, big love’s a gift
I won’t forget you

I’m your brave little soldier
And everything will be alright
I’m your brave little soldier
Coming home to you tonight
Gonna be alright
Gonna be alright, alright."

I'm sorry but it's true
I need a lover
Not someone like you

I been your daddy for too long of a time
Need a little mothering just once in a while
I need a mother
I'm sorry but it's true

It's undercover, the way it's always been
I should have said something
But I didn't know where to begin
You've been taking everything I ever give
But I don't have no more
This ain't no way for me to live
I need a mother
I'm sorry, that's just how it is

I need a mother
It's really nothing new
A little help sometimes

Just once in a while
I need a mother
I'm sorry, but it's true"

Tough life for a mouse

Field mice, head lice
Spiders in the kitchen
Don't think twice 'bout
Whatever keeps you itchin'
Ice water, flyswatter

Walk on coals

257,Blinking Lights (For You),Eels,"Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees
Blinking down a morse code signal
Especially for me

Ain't no rainbow in the sky
In the middle of the night
But the signal's coming through
One day I will be alright again

Blinking lights on the highway cars
Stopping one by one
Get a look at the accident
Didn't see that one coming

And the doctor in the sky
Gonna bring his chopper down
Gonna bring me out alive
And set me on the ground
Once more again

Blinking lights on the airplane wings
Up above the trees"

Hoppin' on my porch
I know it sounds kinda sad
But what's it all for?
Right now you're the only friend I have in the world
And I just can't take out very much
Goddamn
I miss that girl

Little bird
You look all right
I'm sure it's not easy
Gettin' through your night
So tell me this can't be how it's gonna end
Tell me my heart
Somehow
Dear God
Is gonna mend

Can't let her take me out
Without a fight
But right now I can't see making sense of this world
I just can't take out very much
Goddamn
I miss that girl"
260,Sad Foot Sign,Eels,"Sad foot sign, why you gotta
Taunt me this way
The happy side is broken now
It's gonna be an awful day

And if I have to drive back by
To see from a different side
Would it be enough to say
The first time was a lie

Sad foot sign, the end is comin'
That's what they say
Maybe you could, see it in
Your heart for one day

To let me feel what it's about
To really be alive
To live and breathe
And see and feel, then I can die

And when I come back to this room
I'll put on a uniform
And go into, the foot sign shop
Where you were born"
262,Animal,Eels,"If I could love you
I'm sure I would
If I could hold you
And feel understood

I'd be there now
But I don't know how
'Cause I am an animal

Bundle of rags
Wrap me up tight
Keep me safe inside
Warm at night

I am no more
I am not good
I am so sorry
If you misunderstood

I'd make it up
But I cannot
If I am an animal"
264,3 Speed,Eels,"Got a 3 speed and banana seat
Sitting back on the sissy bar
Went to Sev and got a drink
Wish I was driving in Daddy's car

And I looked up at the sky last night
And I thought I saw a bomb
And why won't you just tell me what's going on?

Riding down on Springhill Road
Meeting Alfred out in the woods
Dogs bark and mosquitoes bite
Scratching the itch that makes it feel good

And I looked at into the mirror last night
All I saw was a pretty blonde
And why won't you tell me what's going on?

Life is funny
But not ha ha funny
Peculiar I guess
You think I got it all going my way
Then why am I such a fucking mess?

Want a pony and a birthday cake
Want a party with a scary clown
Kneel down and bow to the princess
Kneel down for the queen of the town

And I looked up at the sky last night
And I thought I saw a bomb
And why won't you tell me what's going on?
Tell me what's going on"
265,Old Shit/New Shit,Eels,"Everyone loves you
Nobody cares
An awful collection
Of enemies and friends
Congratulations to you
With no regrets
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin

They psychic pain
Of living in this world
Is overwhelming me
Again and again
A beautiful afternoon
Inside you in your bed
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin

Nobody loves you
Everyone cares
None of them know what's
Coming 'round the bend
Congratulations to me
Many happy returns
I'm tired of the old shit
Let the new shit begin"
266,Grace Kelly Blues,Eels,"The cut-rate mime
Walking through the dirty streets
Of Paris in the hot August heat
Sun melting the fake smile away
Just looking for a place to stay

The actress gave up all her old dreams
And traded up now she is a queen
Royal families don't have time for that shit
Your crystal ball, you keep it hid

The tractor trailer driver radios:
Help me someone I'm out here all alone
Truck driving the black night away
Prayin' for the light of day

The kid in the mall works at what dog on a stick
His hat is a funny shape his heart is a brick
Taking your order he will look away
He doesn't have a thing to say

But me I'm feeling pretty good as of now
I'm not so sure when I got here or how
Sun melting the fake smile away
I think, you know, I'll be okay"
268,Somebody Loves You,Eels,"Woke up with a bang
And a bug on your face
It crawled in your mouth
And gave you a taste of
The good life you left behind
But I think you're gonna be fine

Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through
Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through

This nagging malaise
Is more than a phase
It feels like a job
But no boss ever pays you to lay there
And think how you'll die
While the tears start to well in your eyes

Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through
Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through

One more Saturday
All alone through the night
You've got to be sure
When you turn out that light
That it's going to turn on again
You've got to be your good friend

Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through
Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through
Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through
Somebody loves you
And you're gonna make it through"
270,Baby Let's Make It Real,Eels,"This is going pretty good
I gotta admit, I didn't see it coming
But everyday since that kiss
Got me thinking do you wanna
Do you wanna do this?

Baby, you're a full meal
The way you make me feel
It's kind of a big deal
Baby, let's make it real

I gotta be careful
Tryna hold onto the past
Can eliminate your future
And you know the past, baby
You know the past, the past never lasts

Baby, you're a full meal
The way you make me feel
It's kind of a big deal
Baby, let's make it real

Girl, bring me joy
Get those high boots on
And dance until God hears you
Don't go against God's plan
Girl, let it fly
Ain't no one gonna stop you
Dance until the earth shakes
Let the beauty and the men cry

Baby, you're a full meal
The way you make me feel
It's kind of a big deal

271,Oh So Lovely,Eels,"My friend was lyin'
The grass was dyin'
It felt like a story you don't care where it leads
A change of venue
Will it mend you?
If the grass is not greener, you know what it needs
I knew that I had to throw down some seeds

Oh-so-lovely
Lord above me
I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways
Everybody
(Yeah!)
Oh-so-lovely
Now how can I tell you how grateful I am?

Fair-weather friends
They make amends
But you look in their eyes and you know it's not real
A little carin'
And soul-barin'
The actor's contract pays him how to feel
I knew it was time to make a new deal

Oh-so-lovely
Lord above me
I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways
Everybody
(Yeah!)
Oh-so-lovely
Now how can I tell you how grateful I am?

Jacaranda bloomin'
No clouds are loomin'
The trees are swayin'
In the wind

Up in the mornin'
Without a warnin'
The sun is a-shinin' like a newborn's smile
It's time I faced it
Don't wanna waste it
I could run away, but that's just not my style
And I think that I just might stay here a while

Oh-so-lovely
Lord above me
I feel my heart changin' in mysterious new ways
Everybody
(Yeah!)
Oh-so-lovely
Now how can I tell you how grateful I am?
Now how can I tell you how grateful I am?

272,It's a Motherf#&!@r,Eels,"It's a Motherfucker
Being here without you
Thinking 'bout the good times
Thinking 'bout the bad
And I won't ever be the same

It's a Motherfucker
Getting through a Sunday
Talking to the walls just me again

But I won't ever be the same
I won't ever be the same

It's a Motherfucker
How much I understand
The feeling that you need someone
To take you by the hand

And you won't ever be the same
You won't ever be the same"
273,Her,Eels,"Nobody's quite sure how it became
That something so good could become of this day
But she's like a dream where you've lost all your fear
And in this life you're lucky to have even one good friend

And it's her that I'll miss in the end

Love stories come and then love stories go
But this is the one that I'll always know
She is the one that makes me believe
And in this life you've got yourself on which you can depend

But it's her that I'll miss in the end
Yeah, it's her that I'll miss in the end

Love is a word that gets thrown 'round a lot
Sometimes it means something other times not
But she is the greatest love I'll ever know
And in this life you'll never know what's waitin' 'round the bend

But it's her that I'll miss in the end
Yeah, it's her that I'll miss in the end
It's her that I'll miss in the end"
274,Checkout Blues,Eels,"I've got something
Maybe I should tell you
I may check out
At any given time

Things won't get better
Until they get much worse
Is the curse stronger than me
Or am I stronger than the curse

Everyone is scared of me
And I'm scared of me too
Never know just what I'm gonna do

Heads up, kittens
Everything is bad
The sky is dark now
But it's the best dark I ever had

Hang on to a little thing
And let it guide the way
Bring it with you to
Another day

I've got something
Maybe I should tell you
I'm hanging on here
And I'm really gonna try

Things won't get better
Until they get much worse
Am I stronger than the curse"
275,Strawberries & Popcorn,Eels,"Nobody here to pester me now
I can do what I want inside of this house
And if I want to eat some strawberries
And popcorn for dinner, well it's up to me

I don't miss getting bossed around
Now it's like you're always out of town
And I can lay down my muddy shoes
On the dining room floor if that's what I choose

Slept all night with the TV on
Spent the whole day with the curtains drawn
Now I'm gonna eat some strawberries
And popcorn for dinner, 'cause that suits me

Strawberries and popcorn

Nobody here to hold me so tight
And keep me warm all through the night
And nobody here to listen to me
Understanding my fears and my dreams

Nobody here to pester me now
I can do what I want inside of this house
If I want to eat some strawberries
And popcorn for dinner, well it's up to me

Strawberries and popcorn"

277,Agony,Eels,"Am I gonna be alright?
No I'm not gonna be alright
Nothin' is alright now
Am I gonna see the sun come up?
Or am I goin' down?
Cause everyday I'm here
All I feel is sheer
Agony

Friends tellin' me that maybe I need
Some psychiatric help
Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you
Just how to get on with it
I look into the mirror
And all I see is age, fear
And agony

If I could just remember what is was like
When I was younger
Before all the joy and happiness
Was replaced with hunger
Now all I've got to show
For the seeds that didn't grow
Is agony"
278,$200 Tattoo,Eels,"It was late, had some drinks
It was only our second date
She looked good, real, real good
I wanted to do what I could

I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking
How deep the water may be
But I knew this was it, we each said to get
A $200 Tattoo

It hurt a little, hell, it hurt a lot
But a man who won't commit is something I'm not
A little tear rolled down her face
When it was done we went back to her place

I'm not one to jump in the pond without checking
How deep the water may be
But I knew she's the one, and I'm telling you, son
I got a $200 Tattoo, she did too
A $200 Tattoo"
279,In My Younger Days,Eels,"In my younger days
This wouldn't have been so hard
I would've just shrugged it off
But now it's tough
I'm not so rough
I've got a little ways to go
It's not over yet, I know
But it feels
Not so far away

In my younger days
This still would've knocked me down
But I would've just bounced right back, you know
Now I'm a statistic
But I'm not fatalistic
I'm not yet resigned to fate
And I'm not gonna be ruled by hate
But it's strong
And it's filling up my days

In my younger days
I would've just chalked it up
As part of my ongoing education
But I've had enough
Been through some stuff
And I don't need any more misery
To teach me what I should be
I just need you back"
280,Things the Grandchildren Should Know,Eels,"I go to bed real early
Everybody thinks it's strange
I get up early in the morning
No matter how disappointed I was
With the day before
It feels new

I don't leave the house much
I don't like being around people
Makes me nervous and weird
I don't like going to shows either
It's better for me to stay at home
Some might think it means I hate people
But that's not quite right

I do some stupid things
But my heart's in the right place
And this I know

I got a dog I take him for a walk
And all the people like to say hello
I'm used to staring down at the sidewalk cracks
I'm learning how to say hello
Without too much trouble

I'm turning out just like my father
Though I swore I never would
Now I can say that I have love for him
I never really understood
What it must have been like for him
Living inside his head
I feel like he's here with me now
Even though he's dead

It's not all good and it's not all bad
Don't believe everything you read
I'm the only one who knows what it's like
So I thought I'd better tell you
Before I leave

So in the end I'd like to say
That I'm a very thankful man
I tried to make the most of my situations
And enjoy what I had
I knew true love and I knew passion
And the difference between the two
And I had some regrets
But if I had to do it all again
Well, it's something I'd like to do"
282,Mansions of los Feliz,Eels,"Well it's a pretty bad place outside this door
I could go out there but I don't see what for
And I'm happy living in the dark
On the edge of my mind
And it's nobody else's business

Now it's just me, myself, and the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz

Well the city's on fire
You can smell the flesh
And the screams like dogs in the wilderness
And where do all the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Like it's everyone else's business

And at best they'll find the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz

La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
La da da da da da da da, la

Well he's gone out again
And left you all alone
Well come on over, I'm always home

And where do all the poor souls go
Looking to mend their hearts
Well I do mean to make it my business

And it's just me, myself, and the secrets
That live within the walls
Of the mansions of Los Feliz

Hoo hoo hoo
Hoo hoo 
Hoo hoo hoo"
285,Tiger in My Tank,Eels,"I bought some rock star ashes
From the back of rolling stone
I guess he wouldn't mind it
They couldn't sell his soul

The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster

I had a dream last night
The TV and the phone
Grew some legs and took a walk
And left me all alone

The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster

When I grow up I'll be
An angry little whore
I'll give you all the finger
I'll sell you all what for

The tiger in my tank
Is going to go extinct
And I'm not feeling so good myself
I think I'm on the brink of disaster"
286,Selective Memory,Eels,"If I lay my head down
I will see you in my dream
Wearing that polka dot dress
And sitting by the stream
Leaning in to hear you
You will whisper in my ear
And everything I need to know
I finally hear

I wish I could remember
But my selective memory
Won't let me

When I was a baby we would
Go out to the park
And sit out in the fountain
Splashing 'round until it's dark
The days go on forever
When you only know that much
And everything you need to know
Is answered with one touch

I wish I could remember
But my selective memory
Won't let me"
287,Whatever Happened to Soy Bomb,Eels,"Blue light is flickering
Through the city streets
One billion TV sets
Glowing off concrete
One day closer to death
I know that I don't have too long
Whatever happened to soy bomb

Lunch box collector loves all the pussycats
But when he goes to bed
He wonders where he's at
Thrift store shirts and old haircuts
Living in an old sitcom
Whatever happened to soy bomb

The day is coming when you'll have to think of it
Was it really worth it
All that shit

Blue light is flickering
Through the cloudy sky
On billion lonely hearts
Beat until they die
One day closer to death
I know that I don't have too long
Whatever happened to soy bomb"
288,Novocaine For The Soul,Eels,"Life is hard
And so am I
You'd better give me something
So I don't die
Novocaine for the soul
Before I sputter out
Before I sputter out

Life is white
And I am black
Jesus and his lawyer
Are coming back
Oh my darling
Will you be here
Before I sputter out [Repeat: x3]

Guess who's living here with the great undead
This paint by numbers life is fucking with my head, once again

Life is good
And I feel great
'cause mother says I was
A great mistake
Novocaine for the soul
You'd better give me something to fill the hole
Before I sputter out [Repeat: x4]"
289,Mr. E's Beautiful Blues,Eels,"The smokestack is spitting black soot into the sooty sky
The load on the road brings a tear to the Indian's eye
The Elephant won't forget what it's like inside his cage
The Ringmaster's Telecaster sings on an empty stage

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
Oh

The girl with the curls and the sweet pink ribbon in her hair
She's crawlin' out her window 'cause her daddy just don't care
(Come on!)

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

The clown with the frown driving down to the sidewalk fair
Finger on the trigger let me tell you it's quite a scare

Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

The kids flip their lids when their heads hear that crazy sound
My neighbor digs the flavor still he's moving to another town
(and I don't believe he'll come back)

God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh
God damn right it's a beautiful day Uh-huh

Your mind don't know how you're taking all the shit you see

290,Ant Farm,Eels,"Hate a lot of things
But I love a few things
And you are one of them

Hard to believe
After all of these years
But you are one of them

Walk down the street
I'm thinking:
Everybody move along
I've got a sad-hearted needing
To belong

Nevertheless
It's all the mess you made
But I can let it go

Walk down the street
I'm thinking:
Look at all the ants in a farm
I've got a sad-hearted feeling
To harm

Hate a lot of things
But I love a few things
And you are one of them"
291,From Which I Came/A Magic World,Eels,"Ten pounds and a head of hair
Came into without a care

What they thought were cries were little laughs
Born and looking forward and moving fast
The little bundle had arrived
And I was happy to be alive
In a magic world

Long days and dreamy nights
Wide eyes taking all the sights
A little wonder goes a long, long way
Learning where to go and what to say
Say hello to your new son

Well, he sure is having fun
In a magic world
Every moment's built to last
When you're living without a past
In a magic world"
292,Flower,Eels,"Turn the ugly light off god
Want to feel the night
Everyday it shines down on me
Don't you think that I see
Don't you think that I see what it's all about

Hard to look the other way
While the world passes me by
And everyone is trying to bum me out 

It's a pretty big world god
And I am awful small
Everyday they rain down on me
Flower in a hailstorm
Flower in a hailstorm
I'm living for the drought
I could throw it back at them
But then I play their game
Everyone is trying to bum me out 

When I came into this world they slapped me
And everyday since then I'm slapped again
Tomorrow's king: an unsightly coward
You see, I know I'm gonna win 

Turn the ugly light off god
Don't want to see my face
Everyday it will betray me
Don't you think that I know
Don't you think that I know what they're talking about
If they step on me tonight
They're gonna pay someday
Everyone is trying to bum me out"
293,Amateur Hour,Eels,"It was a near-perfect morning, the sun was shining
Birds making beautiful sounds
When all of a sudden it finally hit me
Truth came crashing down

Amateur hour
Amateur hour
Baby, you're an amateur
You gotta go pro someday

How did I think to mountain, yeah
So keenly understood
Somebody finally hit my tree
But your branches have no wood

You gotta go pro someday

Sweet, petite, knock me obsolete
You couldn't be better than that
Life can be dumb but I'm not gonna be your fool
No more

It's a near-perfect evening, the moon is glowin'
I don't have a worldly care
Step inside, my hope so high
Since I got you out of my head

Amateur hour
Amateur hour
Baby, you're an amateur
You gotta go pro someday
Someday"
294,Earth To Dora,Eels,"Dear Dora, Earth to Dora, love Earth
Sweet girl, wake up now
You don't know what your worth
So much, look up now see that sun smiling down on you
Give him a hug, he's been smiling since your birth

Hey Dora, what do you know
Magic happens everywhere you go
Silly girl, open your eyes
There's so many things that you don't know
So much just lift up your hat
Who's that smiling at you in the mirror
Give her a kiss
She can smile as long as she wants

Do, do, do, do,
Ba, ba, ba, ba
Do, do, do, do
Ba, ba, ba, ba

Dear Dora, I need a muse
You're my muse, therefore someone needs you
So much, look up now see that sun smiling down on you
Give us a hug, we'll be smiling as long as you're here
Love Mark

295,Understanding Salesmen,Eels,"A knock at the door means
Hello Jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to Niagara falls

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That I must prove to you

A late night card game
With the guys is alright
But I would rather take you
For a test drive

Daddy don't let me down this time
I'm all alone inside my mind
And it's no small thing
That I must prove to you

While I look out
On the passing fields
The sun through the bugs
On the windshield
Makes me feel
Like I
Don't matter

A knock on the door
Hello Jesus calls
A ring on the phone means
A trip to Niagara falls"
297,Jennifer Eccles,Eels,"White chalk, written on red brick
Our love told in a heart
It's there drawn in the playground
Love, kiss, hate or adore

I love Jennifer Eccles
And I know that she loves me
I love Jennifer Eccles
And I know she loves me

I used to carry her satchels
She used to walk by my side
But when we got to her doorstep
Her dad wouldn't let me inside

One Monday morning
Found out I'd made the grade
Started me thinking
That maybe she done the same

I hope that Jennifer Eccles
Is going to follow me there
Our love is bound to continue
Love, kiss, hate or adore

I love Jennifer Eccles
I know that she loves me
I love Jennifer Eccles
And I know that she loves me"
298,Of Unsent Letters,Eels,"Years falling by 
Like the leaves dead in the cold
I've got a desk full of unsent letters
That I should have sent long ago
Dear, long lost love 
It is me
The one who gave up
And I couldn't blame you for cursing my name
And damning the thought of my love

Love hear me out 
Just this once
I swear if you know 
How much I miss you
And what its been like 
Knowing what I can't undo

Hours dragging by 
Like my feet shuffling home
I've got a desk filled with unsent letters
That I should have sent long ago"
299,Taking a Bath In Rust,Eels,"Why don't you
Get me
A way out of here
Buy me a ticket
A seat in the rear

Cause I'd say the daylight
Its time to go home

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
'Get out of here'

I think that you know
Its not so bad
Sitting in rust and taking a bath

But I think that I could
Find a new way

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
'Get out of here'

Why don't you just think
About it a while
Maybe I'm too much
Cramping your style

But now that it's daylight
It's time to go home

Every day
Voice in my ear
Telling me
'Get out of here'"
300,OK,Eels,"I got hurt so what
That's just how it goes
Sometimes that's what a day'll do to you
There were time when I didn't think id see the sun rise
And that was fine by me
I didn't care for being alive
If there was something someone could have told me 
That would have helped one bit
Well I'm sure a lot of you tried

But you know there's nothing 
No one can say 
To do a bit a good
When someone's made up their mind 
To go away

And I don't know what anything means anymore
And I don't know anything for sure
But I know its another day
And I'm okay

You told me it was just a dark night
And I said no, this is something more
But you were right"
301,Grandfather Clock Strikes Twelve,Eels,"Temptation rears it's ugly head upside again

Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Devil's favorite angel fell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Satan wants my soul in hell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Devil's favorite angel fell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve

Peace on Earth, the peace on Earth is all I really need
The rich man with their bags of loot, well, that's just chicken feed
But I got gold and truth be told it's not just in my teeth
This is good and quite worth it whatever lies beneath

Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Devil's favorite angel fell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Satan wants my soul in hell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Devil's favorite angel fell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve

One hour to power up, the countdown does begin
I can't wait to seal my fate, oh God the shape I'm in
The tractor pulls, oh, that's for fools on a Friday night
Whatever's wrong in the world right now, let's just make it right

Grandfather clock strikes twelve

Grandfather clock strikes twelve
(Satan wants my soul in hell)
Grandfather clock strikes twelve

302,"Going to Your Funeral, Pt. 1",Eels,"Going to your funeral now and feeling I could scream
Everything goes away
Driving down the highway through the perfect sunny dream
A perfect day for perfect pain

Look at all the people with the flowers in their hands
They put the flower on the box that's holding all the sand that was...
That was one
That was once you

Honolulu Hurricane I knew that you were not insane
Living in the insane world
Smiling like it's no big deal
Scabby wounds that never heal
The woman was only a girl

Look at all the people with their heads down in their hands
When everything I'm feeling makes it hard to understand that, uh
What I need to miss
It's what I need to miss
Is you

Going to your funeral and I'm feeling like a fool
No one's gonna take the blame
Thinking 'bout the days of hanging out behind the school
Everything goes away"
304,Numbered Days,Eels,"Daisy

Crazy
But I never thought you so
Until now that I see
All the crazy things you're doing
Why you want to ruin it
And me?

Counting numbered days

Lately
I think you know it's true
That's it
It's all over, I'm through
For a while we can smile
For the people that we're passing
And even if they're asking
We can lie

Counting numbered days

Looks like the sun is gonna set
Know that there's nothing I regret
All the things that I learned
Well, I'd like to think I earned it
No need to go and burn it down now

Counting numbered days
Counting numbered days"

Never feel right in these shoes
Pocket full of matches and a head full of flames
Got to warn you that I'm bad news

She tucks me in and then she screams
""one day you will have to choose
Either take care of me or take care of you
And don't pretend you're not bad news""

Come on now I'll take you home
You don't have a thing to lose
But stick around long enough and you'll find out
I am nothing but bad news

You can never change where you're from
No matter who I will accuse
I'm gonna get on with a better life
And one day I won't be bad news

It's the same in the way that you 
Gave me up
In the middle of a swan dive

And I was soaring down
Perfect and slow"
310,Royal Pain,Eels,"I got some sleep and I needed it
Not a lot just a little bit
Someone's always trying to keep me from it

It's a crying shame
It's a royal pain in the neck
I'm just trying to get by
With my pride a little bit intact

Ask me any question and I'll level with you
(I'm with you)
I didn't ask for anything but being with you
That's the only thing I was born to do

And they're all insane
Such a royal pain in the neck
I'm just trying to get by
With my pride a little bit intact

Another day is put to the test
Lord knows I'm doing my best
(Do your best)
Never a brother, always a guest

It's a crying shame
It's a royal pain in the neck

Tip toe through the alley and tip toe through your life
You still got it coming be it gun be it knife
Next thing you know you're eating hospital food

Karaoke castration take the wasp alive
He's gonna sting you anyway and take you to the hive
Yesterday was suckin' and tomorrow's looking bad
Who knew that today was the only thing I had?

Hospital food
Want some hospital food
Hospital food
Delicious Hospital food

In your tribute album to the world you must never forget
To sing the one about the cat who's always getting wet
He's always got a problem he's a very bitter dude
And now he is complaining 'bout his hospital food

Hospital food
It's gonna help the medicine go down
Want some hospital food
Gonna take a walk without a sound
A little hospital food
Helps the spoonful of sugar come up
I want some hospital food
In your blender and in my cup"

With a suitcase on the rack,
White lines shootin by,
On the pavement like the sky
Looking straight ahead into the black

Woman driving, man sleeping
There's no radio to play
Sitting with the map 
Laying crumpled on her lap
Look for the toll money to pay

Man sleeping is man dreaming
In a large apartment house
Walking and knocking on doors

Woman driving man sleeping
Passin all the other cars
Searching in the black
But never turning to look back
A little metal box under the stars

Man sleeping is man dreaming
In a large apartment house
Walkin and knockin on doors

Woman driving man sleeping

But I don't give a damn
She thinks I'm some kind of scum
Cause I don't call her now

Your voice was so grave
I knew it would be
The last time we spoke

You said something
That I couldn't bear
To hear with my own ears
The last time we spoke

And it's a hard time
Trying to get through
All the days that drag on
Thinking about you

Nothing hurts
Like someone who knows
Everything about you
Leaving you behind

All the days that drag on
Thinking about you

When you called
You might as well have killed me
And that was the last time
The last time we spoke"

Even murderous
But I love that
Just like her

I don't have a chance at writing the book

In Jeannie's diary
One single page
In Jeannie's diary

Yes I am intense
Maybe quite obsessed
Everything she does is curious

Is my name on the list?
Want to be of the beautiful people
Want to feel like I'm missed.

Hey you with the walkie-talkie
I know my clothes are not right.
I wish I had my own walkie-talkie
That reached to God every night.

Everyone needs to be somebody
Everyone needs to find someone who cares,
But I don't know if you know what I mean coz
I'm never on your list.

Are you one of the beautiful people?
Am I on the wrong track?
Sometimes it feels like I'm made of eggshells
And it feels like I'm gonna crack.

They don't have a little clue 
What it's like to be me 
What it's like to lose you

I grow weary
I did not mean to let you go so quick 

People talking sound like dogs 
Barking up the wrong tree

And I'm a little too late
By three or four years
And it may not make much sense
Now that we are apart
But I'm going to stop pretending
That I didn't break your heart

You see I never thought enough of myself
To realize that losing me could mean
Something like the tears in your eyes
And I want to tell you I'm sorry
And it's too late to start
But I'm going to stop pretending
That I didn't break your heart

And it's christmas eve
Years down the line
Sitting here wishing I'd treated you better
When you where mine
And I have no way of knowing where you are

That I didn't break your heart

I wanna give you everything
Me and the birds
Now we're gonna sing

When I wake up to your beautiful smile
Sometimes it takes me a little while
To realize that I am awake
And that living today will be
A piece of cake

And I won't keep you for myself
No you're not a toy on my shelf
The world needs to know that you're here
So spread your wings and fly, my dear

Believe it or not, not everyone loves me
But try me, you'll find me, a personality
That you can't get enough of once you can feel

The magic
Feel the magic

I saw you, you saw me, I saw you look away
I went to say hello, you said you had a busy day
I fretted, regretted, and felt myself shrink
I beg you to open your mind, you may be on the brink

Of magic
Feel the magic

I bet it, you fled it, I guess I'm not for you
Projection, rejection, it's really nothing new
So many, not ready, don't see that I'm all this
Alone again and naturally, what do I do

With the magic?
Oh, the magic"

'Fore I go out of my mind over matters
Got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the room

Got a sky that looks like heaven
Got an earth that looks like shit
And it's getting hard to tell where what I am ends
And what they're making me begins

And I won't be denied this time
'Fore I go out of my mind over matters
Got my foot on the ladder
And I'm climbing up to the moon

Saturday in the yard
They'll bring you by
We'll lay down on the grass

Cause you say that you must
But if you think that it matters
Take a look at me
And don't close your eyes as i turn into dust

As if you knew
But you don't know
How Efils good"

So I am pissing in the yard
I have to laugh when I think how far it's gone
But things aren't funny any more

I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did

So I am knocking on the door again
I say, ""Do you want to be alone?""
She says, ""No I don't wanna be alone,
But I think that you do.""

I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it
And she did

And I know she's right
I know how it would be
If I had my own way with the world
As I know it should be

She locked herself in the bathroom again
So I've been shutting down the lights
And I don't know if I'll ever go back again

I drew a line into the dirt
And dared her to step right across it

By nightlights the children pray

I'm so tired of the same old crud
Sweet baby I need fresh blood

The moon shines on the autumn sky
Growin' cold the leaves all die
I'm more alone than I've ever been
Help me out of the shape I'm in

After the fires before the flood
My sweet baby I need fresh blood

Whatever trepidation you may feel
In your heart you know it's not real
In a moment of clarity
Some little act of charity

You gotta pull me out of this mud
Sweet baby I need fresh blood"

Where I can prove something to the world

Dropped us off and said good luck
Then one lucky kid waiting for the bus
Made a winner out of one of us

Passed her name to tha boss
She stuffed ten to a truckbed
She clutches her cross
Here comes tha exhaust
And it rips through her lungs
She's off fast to tha pasture
Like cattle she'll cross
Degree 106
Sweat and vomit are thrown
And she prays and suffocates
Upon tha memories of home
Of Yanqui guns for blood debts on tha loans
Of smoldering fields rape rubble and bones
Of graves hidden trapped up in visions of war
Of nothing no one nobody no more
These are her mountains and skies and
She radiates
Through history's rivers of blood
She regenerates
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear
She's eternally here
Her time is near
Never conquered but here

To tear away at tha mask

And now she got a quota
Tha needle and thread crucifixion
Sold and shipped across tha new line
Of Mason Dixon
Rippin' through denim
Tha point an inch from her vein
Tha foreman approach
His steps now pound in her brain
His presence it terrifies
And eclipses her days
No minutes to rest
No moment to pray
And with a whisper
He whips her
Her soul chained to his will
""My job is to kill if you forget to take your pill""
Her arms jerks
Tha sisters gather round her and scream
As if in a dream
Eyes on tha crimson stream
Numb as her wrists spit shots of blood to tha floor
I am nothing, no one, nobody, no more

These are her mountains and skies and
She radiates
And through history's rivers of blood
She regenerates
And like tha sun disappears only to reappear

Never conquered but here

Cause we're like outlaws striding while suckers are hiding
Jump behind the bush when you see me driving by'
Hanging out my window, and my magnum taking out some putos
Acting kind of loco I'm just another local
Kid from the street getting paid for my vocals
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

Cause nothing is coming from it
I'm not gonna waste no time fucking around I got ya humming
Humming coming at ya! then you know I had to gat ya!
Time for some action just a fraction of friction
I got the clearance to run the interference
In to your satellite shining a battle light
Sen got the gat and I know that we'll gat you right
Here's an example just a little sample:
How could I just kill a man
One time tried to come in my home take my chrome
I said yo it's on. take cover son or you're assed out
How do you like my chrome then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but I did any way, young punk had to pay
So I just killed a man

Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand
How I could just kill a man

It's gonna be a long time before I finish
One of the many missions that I have to establish
To lite my spliff ignite you with insite so if you ain't down
Bullshit. say some punk tried to get you for your auto
Would call the one time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug, humming coming at ya!
Yeah you know I'm going to gat ya, how do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been, understand where I'm coming from
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket or a faster ducket
Just to stay alive yo I got to say f*ck it
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man
Here is something you can't understand, how I could just kill a man

I had an ace in the hole when it came to that
Yo Z you was packin? You know was strapped
Posse kept rollin' it was hard to get with 'em
So I stepped back, and unbuttoned my Lee denim
They kept coming, just like I figured
So I stepped back, and started sprayin' niggas
What a way to go out, out like a sucker
But I'm on track, like a Long Island train
that can head up your mission, suckers who be dissing
Always on my jock like a snake always hissing
Grabbing and tapping me like Luther Vandross

You treatin me the Z to the D, like a stepchild
Let me tell you homeboy you're livin foul
MC's, you know who you are
On the bandwagon Why Z? 'cause you a star
This is the year when the joker's are wild
When a fag can't hack it and try to bite your style
I get hip to the scheme, before it happens
If it gets wild, then I start cappin
But for now, since everything's calm
Relate to the matter as I drop the bomb
Because I'm housin

Renegades of this time and age 
This is the time and age of renegades 

Since the Prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece 
Right down through the Middle Ages 
Planet earth kept going through changes 
And then no renaissance came, and times continued to change 
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades 
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Malcom X 
They were renegades of their time and age 
The mighty renegades 

We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 
We're the renegades of funk 

From a different solar system many many galaxies away 
We are the force of another creation 
A new musical revelation 
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen 
And groove from land to land singin' electronic chants like 
Zulu nation 

Revelations 
Destroy all nations 
Destroy all nations 
Destroy all nations 
Destroy all nations 
Destroy all nations

And not of empty popping 
We're blessed with the force and the sight of electronics 
With the bass, and the treble the horns and our vocals 
'Cause every time I pop into the beat we get fresh 

There was a time when our music 
Was something called the Big Street beat 
People would gather from all around 
To get down to the big sound 
You had to be a renegade those days 
To take a man to the dance floor

When young run foaming at the mouth with hate
When burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Of walls deny the terror faced
By the children born as ghosts

Yeah, the movement's in motion with mass militant poetry
Now check this out, uggh!

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us
Teaches us to read and right

So called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge
And bow down to their God
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time
Ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back!
Bam! Here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam
Step back, I know who I am
Raise up your ear, I'll drop the style and clear
It's the beats and the lyrics they fear
The rage is relentless
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change
And to counteract
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

The present curriculum
I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
Installed in our minds and attempting
To hold us back
We've got to take it back
Holes in our spirit causin' tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
I'm inferior? Who's inferior?
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system that cares about only one culture
And that is why
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

Hey yo check, we're gonna have to break it, break it, 
break it down

Come on, yeah! Bring it back the other way!

The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit and listen to some of that
Bullshit that he learned in school

Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it
Yet we hang from it
Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' weathermen
To expose and close the doors on those who try
To strangle and mangle the truth
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back

Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on!
We gotta take the power back

396,Microphone Fiend,Rage Against the Machine,"Yo, I was a fiend before I became a teen
I melted microphone instead of cones of ice cream
Music orientated so when hip-hop was originated
Fitted like pieces of puzzles, complicated
Shot grabbed the mic and try to say, "" Yes y'all!""
They tried to take it, and say that I'm too small
Cool, 'Cause I don't get upset
I kick a hole in the speaker, pull the plug, then I jet
Back to the lab, without a mic to grab
So then I add all the rhymes I had
One after the another one, then I make another one
To dis the opposite then ask if the brother's done
I get a craving like I fiend for nicotine
But I don't need a cigarette, know what I mean?
I'm raging, ripping up the stage and
Don't it sound amazing 'cause every rhyme is made and
Thought of, 'cause it's sort of, an addiction,
Magnetized by the mixing

But back to the problem, I gotta habit
You can't solve it, you silly rabbit
The prescription is a hypertone that's thorough when
I fiend for a microphone like heroin
Soon as the bass kicks, I need a fix
Gimme a stage and a mic and a mix
And I'll put you in a mood or is it a state of unawareness? 
Beware, it's the reaniamator!
A menace to a microphone, a lethal weapon
An assasinator, if the people ain't stepping
You see a part of me that you never seen
When I'm fiending for a microphone
'Cause I take it to the maximum, I can't relax see, I'm
Hype as a hypochondriac 'cause the rap be one
Hell of a antidote, something you can't smoke
More than dope, you're trying to move away but you can't, you're broke
More than cracked up, you should have backed up
For those who act up need to be more than smacked up

So I rest defense on my ligaments
Pistol grip pump on my lap, riskin it
Full life living it, never giving it back
Too late for slipping, so slack up
On my lap its on your lips so track shot
A steel dick more clip for pump but

In my civic or in this show biz

Never understood it, but remember I showed you
That in these times you gotta look over your shoulder, strap
Well that ain't nothin' but the intent of gettin high
And a cop giving you shit for just passing you by
If your ever in trouble or on the double best to call your pals
If you got none buy a shotgun
Got a new new style
Around me

Are we getting along? We family, we better be
We got your back, we got your back kid
Just don't be pointing one of them guns, allright man

When burning batons beat the freezing who shake
Under the toxic sunsets they dine and toast
Of walls deny the terror faced

It hadda be flashin' like the daily double
Hadda be playin' on TV
Hadda be loud mouthed on the comedy hour
Hadda be announced over loud speakers
The CIA and the Mafia are in cahoots
It hadda be said in old ladies' language
It hadda be said in American headlines
Kennedy stretched and smiled
And got double crossed by lowlife goons and agents
Rich bankers with criminal connections
Dope pushers in CIA working with
Dope pushers from Cuba working with
Big time syndicate Tampa, Florida

It hadda be said with a big mouth
It hadda be moaned over factory foghorns
It hadda be chattered on car radio news broadcasts
It hadda be screamed in the kitchen

It hadda be yelled in the basement where uncles were fighting
It hadda be howled on the streets by newsboys to bus conductors
It hadda be foghorned into New York harbor
It hadda echo under hard hats

It hadda turn up the volume in the university ballrooms
Hadda be written in library books, footnoted
Hadda be in the headlines of the Times and Le Monde
It hadda be barked over TV

Hadda be heard in side alleys through ballroom doors
It hadda be played on wire services
Hadda be bells ringing
Comedians stopped dead in the middle of a joke in Las Vegas

Haddda be FBI chief J. Edgar Hoover
And Frank Costello syndicate mouthpiece
Meeting in Central Park, New York together weekends
Reported Time magazine

Hadda be the Mafia and the CIA together, starting war on Cuba
Bay of Pigs and poison assassination headlines
Hadda be dope cops in the Mafia
Sold all that heroin in America

Hadda be the FBI and organized crime working it together in cahoots
Against the commies

Hadda be ringing on multinational cash registers
World-wide laundry for organized criminal money

Hadda be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI together
Bigger than Nixon and bigger than war

Hadda be a gorged throat full of murder
Hadda be a mounted ass, a solid mass of rage
Hadda be a red hot head
A scream in the back of the throat

Hadda be a Kissinger's brain
Hadda be in Rockefellers' mouth
Hadda be the central intelligence, the family, offing the agency Mafia
One big set of criminal gangs working together in cahoots

Hitmen
Murderers everywhere
Outrage gonna make
Secret, drunk, brutal, dirty, and rich

On top of a slag heap of prisons
Industrial cancer
Plutonium smog
Garbage cities, grandmas' bedsores

Fathers' resentments
Hadda be the rulers
Wanting law and order
And they got rich on wanting protection for the status quo

Wanted junkies
Wanted Attica
Wanted Kent State
Wanted war in Indochina

Yeah, it hadda be the CIA and the Mafia and the FBI
Multinational capitalists
Strong armed squads
Private detective agencies for the oh so very rich

And their armies, their navies and air force bombing planes
Hadda be capitalism
The vortex of this rage
This competition man to man

The horses head in a capitalists' bed
The Cuban's turf competitions
Hitmen in gang wars across oceans

Bombing Cambodia settled the score
With White House pots and pans
A warning to Mediterranean governments

The secret police have braced for decades

The NKPD and CIA keep each other's secrets
The OGBU and DIA never hit their own
The KGB and the FBI, one mind

Brute force and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money
One mind, brute force, and full of money

Hadda murder in Indochina two million

Dressed in slow death

Upon the food that rots slowly in the aisle

That hides the graves beneath the master's hill
Are buried for drinking
The rivers water while
Shackled to the the line at the empty well

Just like the noose wound, over the new ground
This is the new sound, just like the old sound

War is elsewhere
You were chosen
This is Gods land
Soon we'll be free
Of blot and mixture
Seeds planted by our Forefathers hand""

Begin to rupture
Like the pockets Of the new world kings
Like swollen stomachs In Appalachia
Like the priest that fucked you as he whispered holy things
A mass of tears have transform the stones now
Sharpened on suffering 
And woven into the slings
Hope lies in the rubble of this rich fortress
Taking today what tomorrow never brings

Round the time that the school doors close
Round the time that the doors of the jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper
Ain't its funny how the factory doors close
Round the time that the school doors close
Round the time that a hundred thousand jail cells
Open up to greet you like the reaper

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me?

Why do you love me?
There must be something in the water
Cause baby I'm in deeper than I knew
How do you keep me coming back for more
After all we've been through
I can't decide if I should run and hide

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Who knows why I love you
It could be something in the air I breathe
Whatever it is, I depend on it
And where does the time go?
I spend every single moment daydreaming of you
I can't describe how I feel, it feels right

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

You were a shot in the dark that blew me away
And you left your mark and it never will fade
You've ignited a spark, let the fires away
Are you ready, ready?
You have a place in my heart that will always be yours
You are the peak and arc of my universe
Every piece and part, you were the first
I am ready, ready

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you

It's above and beyond me, it's out of my hands
Your love drives me crazy, it's hard to understand just why
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me
I want you to love me

Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?
Why do you love me, do you love me?"
480,If It Hadn't Been For Love,Adele,"I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda run through the blindin' rain
Without one dollar to my name
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

I never woulda seen the trouble that I'm in
If it hadn't been for love
Woulda been gone like a wayward wind
If it hadn't been for love
Nobody knows it better than me
I wouldn't be wishing I was free
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

Four cold walls against my will
At least I know he's lying still
Four cold walls without parole
Lord have mercy on my soul

I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana
If it hadn't been for love
I never woulda loaded up a forty-four
Put myself behind a jailhouse door
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes
If it hadn't been, if it hadn't been for love, yes"
481,"That's It, I Quit, I'm Moving On",Adele,"When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
An you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Ye that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on

Oh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Fill me
So if you got
Someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
So that's it baby
I quit I'm movin' on
Ye that's it baby
I quit now
I'm movin' on"
482,He Won't Go,Adele,"Some say, I'll be better without you,
They don't know you like I do,
Or at least as far as I thought I knew
I can't bear this time,
It drags, as I lose my mind
Reminded by things I find
I know some clothes you left behind.
Wake me up, wake me up when all is done
I won't rise until this battle's won
My dignity is become undone

But I won't go
I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own,
If this is ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

So petrified, I'm so scared to step into this right,
What if I lose my heart and fail the ?
I won't forgive me if I gave up trying
I heard his voice today
I didn't know a single word he said
Now I'm resemblance to the man I met
Just a vague and broken boy instead

But I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

There will be times, we'll try and give it up
Bursting at the seams, no doubt
We almost fall apart and burn up easy
So watch them turn to dust
But nothing will never taint us

I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk
I won't go, I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

Will he, will he still remember me?
Will he still love me even when he's free
Or will he go back to the place where
He will choose the poison over me?
When we spoke yesterday
He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait
I'll be home soon, I won't be late

He won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
He's willing to take the risk
So I won't go, I can't do it on his own,
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk

'Cause he won't go
He can't do it on his own
If this ain't love, then what is?
We're willing to take the risk
I won't go! I can't do it on my own
If this ain't love, then what is?
I'm willing to take the risk"
484,"Right as Rain [Live at Roxy, Los Angeles] [North American Tour Film] [L",Adele,"Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're all on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]
Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

[Chorus]

Go ahead and still (it's not steal) my heart
To make me cry again
Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm all on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
So who want to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

[Chorus]"
485,Easy On Me,Adele,"There ain't no gold in this river
That I've been washin' my hands in forever
I know there is hope in these waters
But I can't bring myself to swim
When I am drowning in this silence
Baby, let me in

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

There ain't no room for things to change
When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I have tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
Didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
Had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me

I had good intentions
And the highest hopes
But I know right now
That probably doesn't even show

Go easy on me, baby
I was still a child
I didn't get the chance to
Feel the world around me
I had no time to choose
What I chose to do
So go easy on me"
487,Wild Wild West,Adele,"I grew a nipper in the wild, wild west
And for a while I was at my best
So much so that I got hitched in a big white dress
But all it did was make me so sad and stressed
And so I got soaked in the wild, wild west
I was galivanting in the silhouettes
That's when I met a jingler in the, in the wild west
While he was sparrow catching in the wilderness

Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya

From L.A. to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego

I'm cuttin' shines in the wild, wild west
I had to bed my man down to save myself
That's when I, I got churched in the, in the wild west
Not that I care, I find God so hard to impress

Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
(Don't waste your time)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill
(I'll shoot you down)
Don't waste your time when I got a backbone of steel
(Don't waste your time)
Don't push me once or I'll shoot a look that will kill ya

From L.A. to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I broke my heart in San Diego

Wild in the west (it's so wild)
It's so wild in the west
(It's so wild, it's so wild)
(It's so wild in the west)
Wild, wild west

From L.A. to San Francisco
Lost my mind in (I lost my mind) San Bernardino
(In Chula) Chula Vista and Modesto
Broke my heart (broke my heart) in San Diego
From L.A. to San Francisco
I lost my mind in San Bernardino
Even Chula Vista and Modesto
I break my heart wherever I go"
488,One and Only,Adele,"You've been on my mind
I grow fonder every day
Lose myself in time
Just thinking of your face
God only knows why it's taken me 
So long to let my doubts go
You're the only one that I wanted

I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
With every feeling every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

If I've been on your mind
Do you hang on every word I say
Lose yourself in time
At the mention of my name
Will I ever know how it feels to hold you close
And have you tell me 
Whichever road I choose you'll go?

I don't know why I'm scared
'Cause I've been here before
With every feeling and every word
I've imagined it all
You'll never know if you never try
To forget your past and simply be mine

I dare you to let me be your, your one and only
I promise I'm worthy 
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
I know it ain't easy giving up your heart
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart) trust me I've learned it
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
(I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)
Nobody's perfect (I know it ain't easy giving up your heart)

So I dare you to let me be your your one and only
I promise I'm worthy
To hold in your arms
So come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts

Come on and give me the chance
To prove that I am the one who can walk that mile
Until the end starts
Now"
489,Hometown Glory,Adele,"I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And turning my heel and strutting my feet
""Is there anything I can do for you dear?
Is there anyone I could call?""
""No and thank you, please Madam.
I ain't lost, just wandering""

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of now

I like it in the city when the air is so thick and opaque
I love to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides

Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united

Round my hometown
Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met yea

Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Of my world, yeah
Of my world
Of my world, yeah"
491,Melt My Heart to Stone,Adele,"Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love"
493,Million Years Ago,Adele,"I only wanted to have fun
Learning to fly, learning to run
I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes I'd have to pay
And bear my soul

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago

When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day

I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
A million years ago"
494,Crazy for You,Adele,"Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you"
495,Don't You Remember,Adele,"When will I see you again?
You left with no goodbye, not a single word was said
No final kiss to seal anything
I had no idea of the state we were in

I know I have a fickle heart and a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

When was the last time you thought of me?
Or have you completely erased me from your memories?
I often think about where I went wrong
The more I do, the less I know

But I know I have a fickle heart and  a bitterness
And a wandering eye, and a heaviness in my head
But don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more

Oh, I gave you the space so you could breathe
I kept my distance so you would be free
In hope that you find the missing piece
To bring you back to me

Why don't you remember, don't you remember?
The reason you loved me before
Baby please remember me once more
When will I see you again?"
500,Skyfall,Adele,"This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again

For this is the end
I’ve drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue I owe them
Swept away, I’m stolen

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall
At skyfall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you’ll never have my heart

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I’d never be me
Without the security
Of your loving arms
Keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand
And we’ll stand

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together

Let the sky fall
When it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
At skyfall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At skyfall"
501,Woman Like Me,Adele,"You're driving me away
Give me a reason to stay
I want to be lost in you
But not in this way

I don't think you quite understand
Who you have on your hands
How can you not see
Just how good for you I am?

I know that you've been hurt before
That's why you feel so insecure
I begged you to let me in
'Cause I only want to be the cure

If you don't choose to grow
We ain't ever gonna know
Just how good this could be
I really hoped that this would go somewhere

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

All you do is complain
About decisions you make
How can I help lift you
If you refuse to activate
The life that you truly want?
I know it's hard, but it's not
We come from the same place
But you will never give it up

It's where they make you feel powerful
That's why you think I make you feel small
But that's your projection
It's not my rejection

I put my heart on the line
For the very first time
Because you asked me to
And now you've gone and changed your mind

But loving you was a breakthrough
I saw what my heart can really do
Now some other man will get
The love I have for you
'Cause you don't care, hmm

Complacency is the worst trait to have
Are you crazy?
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy
Consistency is the gift to give for free
And it is key
To ever keep, to ever keep a woman like me

A woman like me
One more time

Complacency is the worst trait to have (woman like me, woman like me)
Are you crazy? (Woman like me)
You ain't ever had, ain't ever had a woman like me (woman like me)
It is so sad a man like you could be so lazy (woman like me)
Consistency is the gift to give for free (woman like me)
And it is key"
502,I Miss You,Adele,"I want every single piece of you
I want your heaven and your ocean's too
Treat me soft but touch me cool
I wanna teach you things you never knew, baby
Bring the floor up to my knees
Let me fall into your gravity
And kiss me back to life to see
Your body standing over me

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I love the way your body moves
Towards me from across the room
Brushing past my every groove
No one has me like you do, baby
Bring your heart, I'll bring my soul
But be delicate with my ego
I wanna step into your great unknown
With you and me setting the tone

Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Baby don't let the lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Lights go down, lights go down
Down, down, down, down

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

We play so dirty in the dark
'Cause we are living worlds apart
It only makes it harder baby
It only makes it harder baby (harder baby)
Harder baby (harder baby), harder baby

I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light
I miss you when the lights go out
It illuminates all of my doubts
Pull me in, hold me tight
Don't let go, baby give me light

I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you"
504,To Be Loved,Adele,"I built a house for love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried

I'm so afraid but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Trying to learn to lean in to it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe 'til the time feels right

But oh my, oh my
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted

To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice but I can't live a lie
Let it be known

Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried"

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare

They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
It all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat"

It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I walk in a room I'm invisible
I feel like a ghost (ooh-ooh, ooh)
All my friends keep on telling me that 
This feeling won't last, mm (ooh-ooh, ooh)
I can't get no relief, I'm so tired of myself
I swear I'm dead in the eyes (ooh-ooh, ooh)
I have nothing to feel no more
I can't even cry (ooh-ooh, ooh)

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

Cry your heart out
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace

When I wake up, I'm afraid 
At the idea of facing the day (ooh-ooh, ooh)
I would rather stay home on my own
Drink it all away (ooh-ooh, ooh)
Please stop calling me, it's exhausting
There's really nothing left to say (ooh-ooh, ooh)
I created this storm
It's only fair I have to sit in its rain (ooh-ooh, ooh)

When will I begin to feel like me again?
I'm hanging by a thread
My skin's paper thin, I can't stop wavering
I've never been more scared

Cry your heart out

All love is devout
No feeling is a waste
But give it to yourself now
Before it's too late
In the end it's just you
Stop drowning in wait
Your love is useless without it

Cry your heart out (cry, yeah)
It'll clean your face
When you're in doubt
Go at your own pace"
511,Love is a Game,Adele,"All your expectations of my love are impossible
Surely you know, that I'm not easy to hold
It's so sad how incapable of learning to grow I am
My heart speaks in puzzle and codes
I've been trying my whole life to solve
God only knows how I've cried
I can't take another defeat
A next time would be the ending of me
Now that I see

That love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

How unbelievable (unbelievable)
Of me to fall for the lies that I tell? (Lies I tell)
The dream that I sell? (Dream I sell)
When heartache, it's inevitable (and unbearable)
But I'm no good at doing it well
Not that I care (I don't care)
Why should anything about it be fair?

When love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling again (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

No amount of love, can keep me satisfied (satisfied, satisfied)
I can't keep up (can't keep up, can't keep up)
When I keep changing my mind (change my mind, change my mind)
The feelings flood me to the heights of no compromise

Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain
Love is a game for fools to play
And I ain't fooling (fooling), what a cruel thing (cruel thing)
To self-inflict that pain

I can love, I can love again
I love me now, like I love him
I'm a fool for that
You know I, you know I'm gonna do it
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'd do it all again like I did it"
512,My Little Love,Adele,"Mmh, mmh-mhm

My little love
I see your eyes widen like an ocean
When you look at me so full of my emotions
I'm finding it hard to be here sincerely
I know you feel lost, it's my fault completely

Tell me you love me
I love you a million percent

I don't recognize myself in the coldness of the daylight
So I ain't surprised you can read through all of my lies
I feel so bad to be here when I'm so guilty
I'm so far gone and you're the only one who can save me

Oi, I feel like you don't love me
Why do you feel like that?
Don't you like me?
You know mommy doesn't like 
Anyone else like I like you, right?

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mummy's been having a lot of big feelings recently
Like how?
Just, like, hang on, um, my fingers are trapped
Like, um, I feel a bit confused 
Why?
I don't know and I feel 
Like I don't really know what I'm doing
Oh, at all?
At all
And that would make you go, ""Ay, yi, yi""

My little love
Tell me, do you feel the way my past aches?
When you lay on me, can you hear the way my heart breaks?
I wanted you to have everything I never had
I'm so sorry if what I've done makes you feel sad

I love your dad 'cause he gave you to me
You're half me and you're half daddy
Oh

I'm holdin' on (barely)
Mama's got a lot to learn (it's heavy)
I'm holdin' on (catch me)
Mama's got a lot to learn (teach me)

Mmh, mmh-mhm

I'm having a bad day, I'm having a very anxious day
I feel very paranoid, feel very stressed
Um, I have a hangover, which never helps, but
I feel like today is the first day since I left him that I feel lonely
And I never feel lonely, I love being on my own
I always preferred being on my own than being with people
And I feel like maybe I've been, like, overcompensating
And being out and, and stuff like that to keep my mind off of it
And I feel like today, I'm home, and I wanna be at home
I just wanna watch TV and curl up into a ball and 
Be in my sweats and stuff like that
But I just feel really lonely
I feel a bit frightened that I might feel like this a lot"

517,"That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On",Adele,"When we used
To say goodnight
I'd always kiss
And hold you tight
But lately
You don't seem
To care
You close the door
And leave me
Standing there
Oh, honey
That's not fair
That's it
I quit
I'm movin' on

The other night
We had a date
And you showed up
Two hours late
And though your hair
Was all in place
Somebody smeared
Their lipstick
On your face
Oh, they smeared it
Every place
Yeah, yeah that's it, honey
I quit, I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I
Can't have you the way
I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Sooth me so
If you've got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know
Yeah, that's it, honey
I quit, I'm movin' on

Oooohhhh

You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble
And fall
But if I can't have you
The way I want you
I don't want you at all

Baby
I can take a lot
'Cause I love
Everything you got
Though your kisses
Sooth me so
If you got someone else
I gotta go
Oh, that you know

You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again

However far away I will always love you
However long I stay I will always love you

520,Hold On,Adele,"Hold on
You are still strong
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

Oh, what have I done yet again?
Have I not learned anything?
I don't want to live in chaos
It's like a ride that I want to get off
It's hard to hold onto who I am
When I'm stumbling in the dark for a hand
I am so tired of battling with myself
With no chance to win

Hold on
Let time be patient
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come
Just hold, hold on

I swear to God, I am such a mess
The harder that I try, I regress
I'm my own worst enemy
Right now I truly hate being me
Every day feels like the road I'm on
Might just open up and swallow me whole
How do I feel so mighty small
When I'm struggling to feel at all?

Just hold on
Let time be patient (you)
You are still strong
Let pain be gracious 
(Love will soon come)
Just hold (you, just hold on, you, just hold on) 
Hold on (you, just hold on, just hold on)

Sometimes loneliness is the only rest we get 
(Just hold on, just hold on)
And the emptiness actually lets us forget 
(Just hold on, just hold on)
Sometimes forgiveness is easiest in secret 
(Just hold on, just hold on, just hold on, just hold on)

So just hold on, ooh-ooh
Let time be patient 
(You are still strong)
Let pain be gracious
Love will soon come, baby
If you just hold on

Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on (hold on)
Just let time be patient (you)
'Cause you're still strong
You're still strong (are still strong)
Just be gracious
Love will soon come
If you just hold on, mm

521,Chasing Pavements,Adele,"I've made up my mind
Don't need to think it over
If I'm wrong I am right
Don't need to look no further
This ain't lust
I know this is love but

If I tell the world
I'll never say enough
Cause it was not said to you
And that's exactly what I need to do
If I'm in love with you

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere

I'd build myself up
And fly around in circles
Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle
Finally could this be it or

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere yeah

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if, it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up,
Or should I just keep on chasing pavements?
Should I just keep on chasing pavements? Or

Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere
Or would it be a waste?
Even if I knew my place should I leave it there?
Should I give up
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?
Even if it leads nowhere"
523,I'll Be Waiting,Adele,"Hold me closer, one more time
Say that you love me in your last goodbye
Please forgive me, for my sins
Yes, I swam dirty waters
But you pushed me in
I've seen your face, under every sky
Over every border and on every line
You know my heart, more than I do
We were the greatest, me and you

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you,
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Let me stay here for just one more night
Build your world around me
And pull me to the light
So I can tell you that I was wrong
I was a child then, but now I'm willing to learn

But we had time against us
And miles between us
The heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
But now the sky has cleared and it's blue
And I see my future in you

I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better to you

Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
Time against us
Miles between us
Heavens cried
I know I left you speechless
I know I left you speechless

I'll be waiting
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll do everything different
I'll be better to you
I'll be waiting for you when you're ready to love me again
I'll put my hands up
I'll be somebody different
I'll be better for you"
524,Now and Then,Adele,"Sometimes the hole you left hurts
My heart so bad, it cuts through
The deepest parts of me and fills up my mouth with the words that cry
Out, I'm still trying to stay inside

Hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Every now and then my memories ache
With empty ideas of the ones we'd have made it
But as time goes on and my age gets older
I love the ones I know, they're enough to picture the rest

'Cause heart break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

Our hearts break and hearts wait
To make us grow from dust
Then our eyes cry and souls sigh
So that we know that it hurts

You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here
You know when to make me, imagine you're here"
528,Make You Feel My Love,Adele,"When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
Oh, I hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong

I'd go hungry; I'd go black and blue
And I'd go crawling down the avenue
No, there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love

The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of this Earth for you
To make you feel my love, oh yes
To make you feel my love"
529,Sweetest Devotion,Adele,"With your loving, there ain't nothing
That I can't adore
The way I'm running, with you, honey
Means we can break every law
I find it funny that you're the only
One I never looked for
There is something in your loving
That tears down my walls

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I'll forever be whatever you want me to be
I'll go under and all over for your clarity
When you wonder if I'm gonna lose my way home
Just remember, that come whatever, I'll be yours all alone

I wasn't ready then, I'm ready now
I'm heading straight for you
You will only be eternally
The one that I belong to

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

I've been looking for you, baby
In every face that I've ever known
And there is something 'bout the way you love me
That finally feels like home
You're my light, you're my darkness
You're the right kind of madness
And you're my hope, you're my despair
You're my scope, everything, everywhere

The sweetest devotion
Hitting me like an explosion
All of my life, I've been frozen
The sweetest devotion I've known

Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest
Sweetest
It's the sweetest

530,Take It All,Adele,"Didn't I give it all?
Tried my best
Gave you everything I had, everything and no less
Didn't I do it right?
Did I let you down?
Maybe you got too used to having me 'round
Still how can you walk away
From all my tears
It's gonna be an empty road without me right here
But go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love

Maybe I should leave, to help you see
Nothing is better than this and this is everything we need
So is it over?
Is this really it, you're giving up so easily
I thought you loved me more than this

But go on, go on, take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all with my love, take it all with my love

I will change if I must
Slow it down and bring it home, I will adjust
Oh if only, if only you knew
Everything I do, is for you

But go on, go on and take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it, take it all with you
Don't look back at this crumbling fool
Just take it all, with my love
Take it all with my love
You take it all with my love"
531,Right As Rain,Adele,"Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

No room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love"

533,All I Ask,Adele,"I will leave my heart at the door
I won't say a word
They've all been said before you know
So why don't we just play pretend
Like we're not scared of what's coming next
Or scared of having nothing left

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

I don't need your honesty
It's already in your eyes
And I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me
No one knows me like you do
And since you're the only one that matters
Tell me who do I run to?

Look, don't get me wrong
I know there is no tomorrow
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?

Let this be our lesson in love
Let this be the way we remember us
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious
And I ain't asking for forgiveness
All I ask is

If this is my last night with you
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend
Give me a memory I can use
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do
It matters how this ends
'Cause what if I never love again?"
534,Fool That I Am,Adele,"Fool that I am for falling in love with you
And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too

You took my heart then played the part of little coquette
And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette

Fool that I am for hoping you'd understand
And thinking you would listen to all of the thins
The things I had planned

But we couldn't see eye to eye
So darling
Darling
Darling this is goodbye

Oh
I still care
Ooh
I still care
Fool that I am"

'Cause I love you
Yes I do and always loved you"
537,Melt My Heart To Stone,Adele,"Right under my feet there's air made of bricks
Pulls me down turns me weak for you
I find myself repeating like a broken tune
And I'm forever excusing your intentions
That I give in to my pretendings
Which forgive you each time
Without me knowing
They melt my heart to stone

[Chorus]
And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Each and every time I turn around to leave
I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed
So desperately I try to link it with my head
But instead I fall back to my knees
As you tear your way right through me
I forgive you once again
Without me knowing
You've burnt my heart to stone

And I hear your words that I made up
You say my name like there could be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one in love
I'm the only one in love

Why do you steal my hand
Whenever I'm standing my own ground
You build me up, then leave me dead

I hear your words you made up
I say your name like there should be an us
I best tidy up my head I'm the only one, in love
I'm the only one in love"
546,Set Fire to the Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was
The last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name,
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time

Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn"
547,Daydreamer,Adele,"Daydreamer
Sitting on the sea
Soaking up the sun
He is a real lover
And making up the past
Feeling up his girl
Like he's never felt a figure before

A jaw dropper
Looks good when he walks
Is the subject of their talk
He would be hard to chase
But good to catch
And he could change the world
With his hands behind his back, oh

You can find him sittin' on your doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And you can tell that he'll be there for life

Daydreamer
With eyes that make you melt
He lends his coat for shelter
Plus he's there for you
When he shouldn't be
But he stays all the same
Waits for you
Then sees you through

There's no way I
Could describe him
What I'll say is
Just what I'm hoping for

But I will find him sittin' on my doorstep
Waiting for a surprise
And he will feel like he's been there for hours
And I can tell that he'll be there for life
And I can tell that he'll be there for life"
548,Love in the Dark,Adele,"Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are
Don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind
I'm being cruel to be kind

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart
I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave
Stop asking me to stay

I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me

We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live
And not just survive

That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Maybe we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me"
550,Strangers By Nature,Adele,"I'll be taking flowers to the cemetery of my heart
For all of my lovers in the present and in the dark
Every anniversary, I'll pay respects and say I'm sorry
For they never stood a chance as if they could
When no one knows what it's like to be us

I've never seen the sky this color before
It's like I'm noticing everythin' a little bit more
Now that all the dust has settled
I rebut all my rebuttals
No one knows what it's like to be us

Strangers by nature
Strangers by nature

Will I ever get there?
Oh, I hope that someday I'll learn
To nurture what I've done

Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Mmh-mhm-mhm-mhm-mm
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh
Alright then, I'm ready"
551,Rumour Has It,Adele,"She, she ain't real
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will
She is a stranger
You and I have history
Or don't you remember
Sure, she's got it all
But, baby, is that really what you want

Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds
You made a fool out of you
And, boy, she's bringing you down
She made your heart melt
But you're cold to the core
Now rumor has it she ain't got your love anymore

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

She is half your age
But I'm guessing that's the reason that you stayed
I heard you've been missing me
You've been telling people things that you shouldn't be
Like when we creep out and she ain't around
Haven't you heard the rumors

Bless your soul, you've got your head in the clouds
You made a fool out of me
And, boy, you're bringing me down
You made my heart melt, yet I'm cold to the core
But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving her for

Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh
Rumor has it, ooh

All of these words whispered in my ear
Tell a story that I cannot bear to hear
Just 'cause I said it, it don't mean that I meant it
People say crazy things
Just 'cause I said it, don't mean that I meant it
Just 'cause you heard it

Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,
Rumor has it, ooh,

552,All Night Parking,Adele,"I know you've got things to do (I do too)
I just want to spend all my time with you (feels so good)
I'm so hard to impress
Don't leave me on this stretch alone
When I'm out at a party
I'm just excited to get home
And dream about you
All night long

I don't know how you got through to me (I'm so cold)
It's all happening so easily (like, ""Oh my God"")
It's so hard to digest
Usually, I'm best alone
But every time that you text
I want to get on the next flight home
And dream next to you
All night long

Maybe it's the way you remind me of (where I come from)
Or how you make me feel beautiful (and then some)
The sight of you is dramatic
One glimpse and I panic inside
I get lost in our hours
'Cause you possess powers I can't fight
That's why I dream about you
All night long

All night long
All night"
554,River Lea,Adele,"Everybody tells me it's 'bout time that I moved on
And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young
But my heart is a valley, it's so shallow and man made
I'm scared to death if I let you in that you'll see I'm just a fake
Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch
But I know that's just me, 'cause nothing ever is enough
When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea
There was something in the water, now that something's in me
Oh I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain
So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

I should probably tell you now before it's way too late
That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face
Consider this my apology, I know it's years in advance
But I'd rather say it now in case I never get the chance
No, I can't go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips
I can't go back to the river

But it's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

It's in my roots, it's in my veins
It's in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea

So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea
Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea"
556,I Drink Wine,Adele,"How can one become so bounded
By choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version
Of a person we don't even like?

We're in love with the world
But the world just wants to bring us down
By putting ideas in our heads
That corrupt our hearts somehow

When I was a child
Every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun
But now I only soak up wine

They say to play hard, you work hard
Find balance in the sacrifice
Yet I don't know anybody
Who's truly satisfied

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser (ahh)

So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants something
You just want me

Why am I obsessing
About the things I can't control?
Why am I seeking approval
From people I don't even know?

In these crazy times I hope to find 
Something I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life
Something real, something that feels true

You better believe for you I've cried (I've cried, I've cried)
High tides (high tides, high tides)
'Cause I want you so bad
But you can't fight fire with fire (ahh)

Oh, so I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) 
Love you for free (each other for free)
Everybody wants something from me
You just want me

Listen, I know how low I can go
I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all
'Cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time (hope in time)
We both will find (we both find) peace of mind
Sometimes the road less traveled
Is a road best left behind (ahh)

Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop trying to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you (so we can love) 
Love you for free, yeah (each other for free)
'Cause everybody wants something from me
You just want me

You better believe I'm trying (trying, trying)
To keep climbing (climbing, climbing)
But the higher we climb
Feels like we're both none the wiser

The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just like a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in a big storm"
557,Someone Like You,Adele,"I heard, that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're, married now

I heard, that your dreams came true
I guess she gave you things
I didn't give to you

Old friend, why are you so shy
Ain't like you to hold back
Or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best
For you too, don't forget me
I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead yeah

You know how the time flies
Only yesterday it was the time of our lives
We were born and raised
In a summer haze bound by the surprise
Of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but I
Couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
I hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Nothing compares no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes their memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet
This would taste

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Never mind I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you too
Don't forget me I beg, I'll remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead"
561,Lay Me Down,Adele,"I would never lie to you unless you tell me to
Every part of me, all my words to hold
And hold against me, why won't you let it be?

Don't you ever say my love opened up your heart
No I'm not gonna do it standing up
The words don't come out right when you're right in front of me
Help me baby, won't you turn off the lights

Lay me down ('til the morning)
Lay me down (through the night)
Lay me down (I can fall in)
Lay me down (Won't you)
Lay me down (I can baby)

You can read my mind, be it truth or lies
Lie down beside me, why won't you let it be?

563,Remedy,Adele,"I remember all of the things that I thought I wanted to be
So desperate to find a way out of my world and finally breathe
Right before my eyes I saw that my heart it came to life
This ain't easy it's not meant to be
Every story has its scars

But when the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy

No river is too wide or too deep for me to swim to you
Come whatever I'll be the shelter that won't let the rain come through
Your love, it is my truth
And I will always love you
Love you

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
That I will be your remedy
When the world seems so cruel
And your heart makes you feel like a fool
I promise you will see
That I will be, I will be your remedy, oh

When the pain cuts you deep
When the night keeps you from sleeping
Just look and you will see
I will be, I will be

Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't ask you, you to just desert me
I can't give you, what you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
To turning tables

Under haunted skies I see you
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no I will never be knocked down

I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe

So I won't let you close enough to hurt me, no
I won't ask you, you to just desert me

You're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment
Before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know

You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you moved overseas
That's what you said, when you left me

You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were
Before we realized
We were sad of getting old
It made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

When we were young

It's hard to admit that
Everything just takes me back
To when you were there
To when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on
Just in case it hasn't gone
I guess I still care
Do you still care?

It was just like a movie
It was just like a song

Of when we were young

When we were young
When we were young
When we were young
When we were young

Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time
That we might be exactly like we were

We were sad of getting old

It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

Why is it every time I think I've tried my hardest
It turns out it ain't enough
You're still not mentioning love
What am I supposed to do to make you want me properly?
I'm taking these chances and getting nowhere
And though I'm trying my hardest you go back to her
And I think that I know things may never change
I'm still hoping one day I might hear you say

I make you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more
Then you'd say all of the right things without a clue
But you'd save the best for last
Like I'm the one for you

You should know that you're just a temporary fix
This is not rooted with you it don't mean that much to me
Oh just a filler in the space that happened to be free
How dare you think you'd get away with trying to play me

But, despite the truth that I know
I find it hard to let go and give up on you
Seems I love the things you do
Like the meaner you treat me the more eager I am
To persist with this heartbreak and running around
And I will do until I'm finding myself you

And make you feel a way you've never felt before
And be all you need so that you never want more
And you'll say all of the right things without a clue
And you'll be the one for me and me the one for you"
583,Rolling In The Deep,Adele,"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go 'head and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare
See how I leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there 'cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love they leave me breathless, I can't help feeling
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turned my sorrow into treasured gold
You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(You're gonna wish you never had met me) We could've had it all
We could've had it all (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
It all, it all, it all, (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand (you're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat (tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it
To the beat"
584,Best For Last,Adele,"Wait, do you see my heart on my sleeve?
It's been there for days on end and
It's been waiting for you to open up
Yours too baby, come on now
I'm trying to tell you just how
I'd like to hear the words roll out of your mouth finally
Say that it's always been me

That's made you feel the way you've never felt before
And I'm all you need and that you never want more

585,Cold Shoulder,Adele,"You say it's all in my head
And the things I think just don't make sense
So where you been then? Don't go all coy
Don't turn it round on me like it's my fault
See I can see that look in your eyes
The one that shoots me each and every time

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it, and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too

When you grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

Time and time again, I play the role of fool
(Just for you)
Even in the daylight when you think that
(I don't see you)
Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me I wish I was her"
586,Set Fire To the Rain,Adele,"I let it fall, my heart,
And as it fell you rose to claim it
It was dark and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me

My hands, they're strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name, 
Your name

When I lay with you
I could stay there
Close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together nothing gets better

'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you play
You would always win, always win

But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, 
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that that was 
The last time, the last time

Sometimes I wake up by the door,
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name, 
Your name

I set fire to the rain,
And I threw us into the flames
Well, it felt something died
'Cause I knew that, that was the last time
The last time

Let it burn 
Let it burn
Let it burn"
587,Hello,Adele,"Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret
That the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore

Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Oh, anymore
Anymore

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must've called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry
For everything that I've done
But when I call you never
Seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry
For breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly
Doesn't tear you apart anymore"
588,Painting Pictures,Adele,"Painting pictures with my mind
Making memories using my eyes
Filling up my heart with golden stories
Who adds some spice to the rhythm of life, oh

Welcome sunrise with the morning glory
I've changed my mind
There is no simple
I thought of me, I want to see
I want to feel my heartbeat so
With the world that you feel, leave

I can feel the pressure pushing onto my heart
And it's teasing me
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can start to begin what's begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Running riots inside my soul
Fire burning and it's lighting me up
To scratch my itch and beat my drum
So I can finish what has begun

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories

Painting pictures
Filling up my heart with golden stories"
589,Water Under the Bridge,Adele,"If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey if I'm not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through

It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless

If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge

Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so

591,Oh My God,Adele,"I ain't got too much time to spare
But I'll make time for you to show how much I care
Wish that I would let you break my walls
But I'm still spinning out of control from the fall
Boy, you give good love, I won't lie
It's what keeps me coming back, even though I'm terrified

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah

I know that it's wrong
But I want to have fun
Mmh, yeah
Mmh, yeah

Oh my God, I can't believe it
Out of all the people in the world
What is the likelihood of jumping 
Out of my life and into your arms?
Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind 
'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right
Teetering on the edge of Heaven and Hell 
Is a battle that I cannot fight

I'm a fool, but they all think I'm blind
I'd rather be a fool than leave myself behind
I don't have to explain myself to you
I am a grown woman and I do what I want to do

I know that it's wrong

592,Can't Be Together,Adele,"You've got your eye on me after all these years
You think that I can't see you from over here
I may be out of your view, but I can hear you
I may be out of the room, but I can see you
I know you still want me, you always will
And I can guarantee I know just how it feels
To never be free completely
Sometimes you just feel so empty

Like lately, when I have been missin' you
And I would still do anything for you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we gotta let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

I was far too reckless, I know that now
Tryna make you jealous made me feel proud
But now I'm in too deep to climb out
But know that I live with my doubt, oh

Like lately, when I have been missin' you
And I want to do everything with you

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we gotta let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
I will love you forever

Since we were together, everybody's changed
And our reflections in the mirror, they no longer look the same
And we're only just beginning to live the lives we'll make
I will always miss you at the end of each day

But we need to learn how to love who we're loving
It's hard but we must, we gotta let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
My love, let's learn how to love who we're loving
It's so hard, but we must, we gotta to let it go
And turn off the urge to know what could have been
But I will love you forever

But we can't be together
No, we won't be together"
593,Right as Rain,Adele,"Who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
You get excitement in your bones
And everything you do's a game
When night comes and you're on your own
You can say I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Who wants to be riding high
When you'll just crumble back on down
You give up everything you are
And even then you don't get far
They make believe that everything
Is exactly what it seems
But at least when you're at your worst
You know how to feel things

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

Go ahead and still my heart
To make me cry again
'Cause it will never hurt
As much as it did then
We were both right
And no one had blame
But now I give up
On this endless game

'Cause who wants to be right as rain
It's better when something is wrong
I get excitement in my bones
Even though everything's a strain
When night comes and I'm on my own
You should know I chose to be alone
Who wants to be right as rain
It's harder when you're on top

'Cause when hard work don't pay off
And I'm tired there ain't no room in my bed
As far as I'm concerned
So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love

So wipe that dirty smile off
We won't be making up
I've cried my heart out
And now I've had enough of love"
594,Can't Let Go,Adele,"When did it go wrong, I will never know
I have loved you all my life
How did it slow down, I go round and round
Thinking about it all the time

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me
This love, it ain't over yet
There's too much that I haven't said

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Why were you so cold, let the truth be told
Tell me was it all for the thrill?
What was I thinking, I gave you everything
But you still went for the kill

I gave you heaven on a platter baby
I gave you everything you never gave me
I never lied and I never faked it
Only wanted for you to save me

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Ooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark
Ooh I thought I'd die in your arms

Did you find the note that I wrote?
I hid it in the seam of your coat
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat
Do you even know that I can't let go

Hope you know, I won't let go"

And created what i..."
596,Tired,Adele,"Hold my hand while you cut me down
It had only just begun but now it's over now
And you're in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold
I'm between the middle watching hastiness unfold
On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night
The night
When I fell off your mind

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired

Where'd you go when you stayed behind
I looked up and inside down and outside only to find
A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile
I get closer you obviously prefer her

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Oy, I'm tired

(I should have known)

Never mind said your open arms
I couldn't help believe they tricked me back into them, even though

I'm tired of trying
Your teasing ain't enough
Fed up of biding your time
When I don't get nothing back
And for what, and for what, and for what
When I don't get nothing back
Boy I'm tired of trying

You can't make your heart feel

When you're holding me

Morning will come
And I'll do what's right
Just give me till then
To give up this fight

And I will give up this fight

I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

I was too strong you were trembling
You couldn't handle the hot heat rising (rising), umm
Baby I'm so rising
I was running, you were walking
You couldn't keep up, you were falling down (down), umm
There's only one way down

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free, oh

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We've both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready
If you're ready, I am ready
If you're ready, if you're ready
We both know we ain't kids no more
No, we ain't kids no more

I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free

Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
Treat her better
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready (Send my love to your new lover)
If you're ready, are you ready? (Treat her better)
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more"
605,Crazy For You,Adele,"Found myself today singing out your name,
You said I'm crazy,
If I am I'm crazy for you.

Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here
Turns me crazy,
But it's you who makes me lose my head.

And every time I'm meant to be acting sensible
You drift into my head
And turn me into a crumbling fool.

Tell me to run and I'll race,
If you want me to stop I'll freeze,
And if you want me gone. I'll leave, just hold me closer baby,
And make me crazy for you.
Crazy for you.

Lately with this state I'm in I can't help myself but spin.
I wish you'd come over,
Send me spinning closer to you.

My oh my, how my blood boils, it's sweet taste for you,
Strips me down bare
And gets me into my favorite mood.

I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away,
But the more I do,
The crazier I turn into.

Pacing floors and opening doors,
Hoping you'll walk through
And save me boy,
Because I'm too crazy for you.
Crazy for you"
606,Rolling in Deep,Adele,"There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
Finally, I can see you crystal clear,
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare,
See how I'll leave with every piece of you,
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.

There's a fire starting in my heart,
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark.
The scars of your love remind me of us,
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
I can't help feeling,

We could have had it all,
(Your gonna wish you, never had met me)
Rolling in the deep,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told,
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn,
Think of me in the depths of your despair,
Making a home down there as mine sure won't be shared,

The scars of your love remind me of us,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
I can't help feeling,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all,
Rolling in the deep,
You had my heart inside of your hands,
But you played it with a beating.

Throw your soul through every open door,
Count your blessings to find what you look for.
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold,
You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown.

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all,
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all.
(You're gonna wish you never had met me),
It all, it all, it all.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hand,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep.
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands,
(You're gonna wish you never had met me

But you played it,
You played it,
You played it,
You played it to the beat."
